<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Marg Hancock works as a Care Coordinator for a provincial agency that delivers a range of health-care services to clients in their homes.</p>

<p>As a Care Coordinator, I manage a caseload of individuals who need support in order to recover from a health-related incident or to remain living as independently as possible at home.</p>

<p>A large part of my job is assessment and partnering with the client to devise the best possible plan to meet specific goals. We use a consistent assessment tool and conduct assessments in the individual&rsquo;s home, taking up to two hours on the initial visit. Another aspect of my work involves &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; and I get a great deal of satisfaction from helping individuals find their way through the local health network. Many of my clients are older adults. Mobility issues may have begun to detract from their ability to access community services. I have some younger clients, too. Some of my peers work exclusively with children. I work in the community now, but I also have hospital expe-rience. I work in a multidisciplinary team consisting of health professionals and a manager.</p>

<p>I arrived at my graduate social work studies with an interest in older adults and palliative care. I selected the &ldquo;family and individuals&rdquo; stream, picking up all the courses on working with seniors as I studied. I benefitted from a placement in a continuing care hospital setting with excellent supervision and I enrolled in community palliative care courses. Upon graduation, while working on a contract in long-term care, a social worker friend told me how much she enjoyed her work as a Care Coordinator. Her agency advertised a position involving work with older adults with a potential for work in palliative care. I applied and was hired.</p>

<p>My work offers significant opportunities to influence the lives of others for the better. I am often introduced to an individual or a family at a time of dynamic life changes when the gateway to intimate conversation is open. This is where the skill of listening has been my biggest ally and the source of greatest satisfaction in my work. I recall, for example, an angry, depressed senior who had alienated her family. Quiet, empathetic listening opened the door to a constructive conversation with her primary support person. I recall a 20-something man with a young family who had sustained permanent injury from a sporting accident. His grief and guilt were barriers to healing. Con-structive listening at his bedside helped him accept that ongoing counselling support should be a part of his care plan.</p>

<p>Conversations can become &ldquo;critical,&rdquo; and I have enhanced my skills to take part in those &ldquo;critical conversations&rdquo; constructively. I frequently find myself in situations where I face an ethical dilemma and am given resources to formulate a model of ethical decision making. There is opportunity to consult with other professionals on behalf of a client. I meet people from all walks of life and provide individualized access to the health care community. My agency&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;outstanding care&mdash;every person, every day&rdquo; is a great fit with social work values. I value the dignity and worth of my clients and I value my own integrity and competence as well.</p>

<p>My job is rewarding and offers tremendous opportunities for learning. It is a secure environment from the perspective of job security, retirement pension, and so on. However, the health care field is under pressure to spend limited health care dollars wisely and Care Coordinators are not immune to those pressures. We handle large caseloads and are held accountable for all the resources we use. We are challenged to work faster and to adopt &ldquo;lean&rdquo; approaches that are not always compatible with spending time with a client.</p>

<p>Care Coordinators must be tolerant of bureaucracy and have skills for stick-handling creative ideas through established policy networks. While organizational and time-management skills are an asset, attention to self-care is essential, too&mdash;and what better setting for keeping your own health and well-being at the forefront than in the health care field!</p>
