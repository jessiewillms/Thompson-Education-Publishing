	<p>The direct social work process outlined below consists of four broad stages: (1) intake, (2) assessment and planning, (3)&#160;intervention, and (4) evaluation and termination.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Intake Stage</p>

	<p>From the first encounter with the person seeking help to the last, the social worker is mindful of the vital importance of the working relationship. Some identify this relationship as a “therapeutic alliance.” A therapeutic alliance exists when both the social worker and the client feel that theirs is a positive working partnership.</p>

	<p>Intake is a process whereby a request for service is put forth either by or for a person, and a social worker responsible for intake then determines whether and what kind of service is to be provided. The social worker attempts to gather initial information to determine what assistance is needed and whether the agency and worker are the appropriate providers. If it is mutually determined that the agency can be of service, then some sort of agreement or contract is drawn up. If it is determined that the client’s needs cannot be met by the agency, then a referral to a different service or agency is made or a decision is made to pursue another route to help.</p>

	<p>During the intake phase, the client makes a personal request for help, or someone from the community directs the client to a particular social work agency. The social work relationship can be either voluntary or involuntary. The intake step is voluntary when a client willingly seeks help from a social work agency. For example, a lone parent struggling to care for a child may approach a child welfare agency for assistance. In contrast, an involuntary client is ordered to see a social worker or is required to do so by law. For example, a social worker is required by law to assist a child in danger when the child’s situation has been reported as unsafe by a physician, hospital worker, police officer, or schoolteacher. In such cases, families are often uncooperative, especially if allegations of child abuse have been reported. Working with involuntary clients can often place more demands on a social worker due to resistance and lower motivation on the part of the client(s).</p>

	<p>In the intake stage, the social worker acknowledges the client’s need for help, collects information from the client, assesses the client’s problem or situation and, based on the agency’s resources, determines if the social work agency can help the client. In essence, when they first meet, both the worker and the client want answers to specific questions. The applicant or potential client wants to know: Can I get the help I need here? Can this person help me? The worker will ask: Can I help this person, or would it be more appropriate for someone else in this or another agency to offer help?</p>

	<p>It is important in this phase for the social worker to clarify his or her role and purpose, as well as the agency’s role. The context of practice is particularly important during the intake phase. In some cases, an agency-mandated intake form or checklist is used. The social worker should ensure that there is some congruence between the mandate of the agency and the issues that are important to the client. In the case of an involuntary client, this congruence is assumed. Finding this similarity forms a kind of contract between client and agency, with the worker as the intermediary. The worker’s function in this initial phase is a form of mediating an engagement between client and agency—a finding of common ground.</p>

	<p>The social worker might start the intake process with an opening statement such as the following:</p>

	<p>“My name is Lorraine, and I am a social worker here at the social work department. Your doctor has asked me to see you regarding your recovery from your operation and challenges you might be having. This can be a difficult time and, if you wish, I would like to offer some assistance.”</p>

	<p>This straightforward statement sets the groundwork and then leaves it open to the client to clarify what the role of the worker might be from his or her perspective.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Assessment and Planning Stage</p>

	<p>During assessment, the social worker and the client analyze what help is needed based on the client’s ideas, thoughts, and feelings. Once the assessment is complete, the social worker formulates a plan in collaboration with the client. The plan is not set in stone but provides an initial course of action, which is reviewed and updated throughout the process. The client is viewed as a partner rather than simply a consulted party.</p>

	<p>Many textbooks describe a process that involves problem definition, data collection, and “objective” recommendations.In this section, we are emphasizing a social work process that stresses reflection-action-reflection, in which the social worker continually thinks things through while acting on the problem at hand and always in consultation with the client. She or he adapts the intervention based on dialogue, reflection on prior experience, and judgements about past actions.</p>

	<p>During the assessment stage, the social worker may also rely on other people who know the client personally, for example, a teacher, doctor, police officer, or Elder. Assessment involves the art of asking questions. Purposeful and well-timed questions are the cornerstone of this phase. Social workers may prefer a structured interview in which they pose a predetermined set of questions. This is usually the case in agencies that require specific forms to be completed as part of the assessment. In other cases, unstructured interviews are the norm. This type of interviewing is still focused, but takes a more conversational tone and is relatively flexible. With the latter approach, beginning social workers must ensure that the interview does not wander too far off topic.</p>

	<p>The planned actions may occur at a variety of levels: individual, environmental, multi-person, systemic, or structural. For example, actions might involve therapeutic, educational, and social action-oriented approaches. What varies between practice models is the focus of attention. A behavioural therapy approach would tend to focus on changing individual behaviours, whereas a social action or structural approach may focus on examining behaviours within a wider context, perhaps exploring how they might be changed, and working toward changing systems in order to shift power relations. There can also be a combination of these approaches. In any event, the social worker assesses the client’s problem with the client and negotiates a plan with the client that includes</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the type of actions or interventions deemed viable,</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the length of the intervention,</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the frequency of meetings and the desired outcomes, and</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the intervention plan (a contract is made with the client).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The concept of empowerment is crucial in the planning phase. The foundation of empowerment is the notion that clients have the right to self-determination and are capable of discerning the best course of action for themselves. Often, clients come in with a negative self-image and a feeling of powerlessness. Sexism or racism may feed into this. This poses a challenge in substituting an attitude of empowerment.</p>

	<p>One response is to use a mindfulness approach to explore clients’ thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Clients are encouraged to see self-deprecating thoughts as just thoughts and not who they are. They are able to learn that they possess an effective intuitive sense and an inner resilience that can be called upon to face and surmount life’s difficulties.</p>

	<p>Other approaches might use consciousness-raising to promote empowerment. Consciousness-raising encourages people to gain insight into their circumstances with a view to changing them. This notion is often associated with progressive, feminist, or structural approaches to social work, but it is increasingly becoming part of many other approaches.</p>

	<p>Consciousness-raising can involve one or more activities, including the provision of information concerning the social structures implicated in the person’s situation, reflection based on the client’s lived experiences, sharing of experiences in common with the worker (if this is appropriate), or conscious-awareness exercises that cultivate insight.</p>

	<p>Part of the consciousness-raising process involves normalization. Normalization highlights the notion that any particular difficulty that a person experiences is universal and not unique to any one person—that many difficulties are a normal part of being human or being part of a particular social group that is being oppressed or marginalized.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Intervention Stage</p>

	<p>The worker, the client, or both may initiate the intervention stage. The actions may be directed toward the client, other individuals, family members, groups, communities, institutions, social policies, or political and social structures. Intervention does not always focus on the treatment of the individual alone. For example, in situations where the social worker is using a structural or feminist approach to practice, the intervention will usually include some kind of organizational, community, or social action measures in addition to working with a client.</p>

	<p>It is through the process of intervention that the worker and the client implement the assessment and the plan that emerged after completing the assessment. The intervention undertaken is directed at meeting the client’s needs as determined by the worker and the client together. In the intervention stage, the client shares with the social worker any information regarding what progress has been made in resolving the problem that is confronting the client.</p>

	<p>During this stage, the social worker</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">establishes a rapport with the client,</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">accompanies the client to meetings with other support personnel as needed (e.g., employment counsellors),</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">provides advice and support to the client,</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">adjusts the intervention based on further information from the client, and</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">helps the client to resolve the problem or situation by providing new knowledge and skills that assist in alleviating the problem or that shift the client’s relationship to the problem in beneficial ways.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The intervention phase should focus on creating an ongoing dialogue between the client and the worker and perhaps others involved in the situation. In cases where the uncertainties loom large or are numerous, it is advisable to take small, cautious steps and then reflect on the intervention. This will allow for an enhanced understanding of the situation and an opportunity for the worker and the client to alter the course of action to suit current realities as they come to light.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Evaluation and Termination Stage</p>

	<p>In this, the final stage, the client and the social worker achieve a resolution or a partial resolution to the problem, preferably one that prevents the situation from occurring again. The social worker evaluates the following items with the client:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the choice of intervention</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the length of the intervention</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the frequency of the meetings between client and worker</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the outcome or outcomes of the intervention</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the need for any follow-up meetings or actions</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">when to terminate the intervention</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Evaluation is an ongoing part of the process. Evaluation should identify a rationale for the actions chosen, whether or not a client’s needs were met, the expected and unexpected effects, and alternative courses of action that may need to be taken.</p>

	<p>Increasingly, there is recognition of the benefits of client participation: clients can have an insider’s perspective on agency functioning; information can be validated; confidentiality can be examined; plans can be adjusted; knowledge can be gained; the client–worker relationship can be strengthened; and clients can be empowered.</p>

	<p>Termination, or the ending of the client–worker relationship, occurs ideally when the action plan has been completed and the client’s goals have been met. In this stage, essential records are organized and stored in a place of safekeeping.</p>

	<p>The use of records raises concerns about the confidentiality of sensitive information: What constitutes the ethical disclosure of information about a client? In addressing this question, social workers are obligated to follow the guidelines of the agency or organization employing them. They must also obey legislation and association policy. The CASW Code of Ethics stipulates, at length, the requirements for collecting, recording, storing, and accessing client records.</p>

	<p>Social workers must ensure that appropriate supports are in place before the intervention is ended. A client who has become dependent on assistance and interaction with the social worker may have difficulties with termination. Helping clients build their own support network is crucial. Such support may come from family and friends, informal helpers, self-help groups, or through community or voluntary activities. If an empowerment perspective is embraced, termination often proceeds more smoothly.</p>
