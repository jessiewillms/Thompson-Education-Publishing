	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Aboriginal children in Canada are over-represented in out-of-home care—making up just 15 percent of the total child population, but 40 percent of children in care.</p>

	<p>The number of investigations into the maltreatment of Aboriginal children is more than four times higher than those involving non-Aboriginal children. Furthermore, over-representation occurs at all stages of these investigations: Aboriginal families are more likely to be investigated, cases are more likely to be substantiated, and children are more likely to be removed from the home. As well, once a file is opened, it is also more likely to stay open.</p>

	<p>The First Nations component of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (Sinha, Ellenbogen, and Trocmé, 2013) analyzed child protection information for First Nations children. It showed that First Nations famiiles were disproportionately investigated for all forms of child maltreatment—twice as frequently for physical abuse and three times as often for sexual abuse. The highest disproportionality was in situations of suspected neglect. First Nations children were the focus of investigations for neglect six times more often than non-Aboriginal children.</p>

	<p class="•-Feature-Text _idGenParaOverride-1">Sinha, Ellenbogen, and Trocmé (2013) examined caregiver and household risk factors associated with the investigation and substantiation of child neglect among First Nations families. They found that the most commonly identified risk factors for First Nations children were substance abuse, domestic violence, and a lack of social supports. The most commonly identified risk factor concerns were low income and caregiving &#160;resource strain.</p>

	<p>Systemic Risks</p>

	<p class="•-Feature-Text ParaOverride-3">The persistent over-representation of Aboriginal famillies in investigations of child maltreatment cannot be adequately understood through the dominant individual and forensic perspectives. It can be tied to the low incomes and poor housing conditions of many First Nations families (Sinha, Trocmé, Blackstock, MacLaurin, and Fallon, 2011), and is exacerbated by social issues of substance use and domestic violence. These issues are structural factors that “place children and families at risk [and] that are largely beyond their ability to control” (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2013).</p>

	<p class="•-Feature-Text ParaOverride-3">Some of these systemic risks are related to federal and provincial jurisdictional disputes, the underfunding of services on reserves, and a failure to provide adequate resources for family support programs (Sinha, Trocmé, Blackstock, MacLaurin, and Fallon, 2011).</p>

	<p class="•-Feature-Text ParaOverride-3">Aboriginal overrepresentation in child abuse and neglect investigations can also be linked to historical practices, in particular, the period of the “Sixties Scoop” and the placement of First Nations children in residential schools.</p>

	<p>Recently, there have been changes to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada’s Directive 20-1 to shift funding models away from in-care options to programs and supports that help First Nations families keep their children at or closer to home. But the systemic risks must also be addressed.</p>

	<p>Structural Interventions</p>

	<p>Blackstock et al. (2006) make the point that it is important for child-welfare workers to differentiate between family risk and structural risk, and to respond meaningfully to both. The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (Martel,&#160;2013) has identified some promising structural interventions and practices:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">Housing. Inadequate housing is a structural risk factor often correlated with poverty. Safe housing is often not accessible (e.g., there is often overcrowding, a lack of clean drinking water, and mould in First Nations housing on-reserve). Developing safe and affordable housing options and/or connecting clients to housing option resources are structural interventions that mitigate the unnecessary removal of a child from the family home. An example is the Native Child and Family Services of Toronto (NCFST), which offers apartments to women and children up to the age of 16 for a stay of up to 18 months. Support services augment the housing stability.</li>

		<li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use. Substance use is a significant contributory risk factor. In order to protect the health and well-being of families and to prevent child maltreatment, substance misuse services must be available and accessible to families. This requires improving training and awareness, as well as collaboration to ensure that substance misuse workers and child welfare workers act together to meet the needs of children and their families. Understanding Substance Abuse and Facilitating Recovery: A Guide for Child Welfare Workers (Breshears, Yeh, and Young, 2009) is a useful resource outlining tools and skills to support child safety in the context of substance misuse.</li>
		
		<li class="li--bullet-item">Poverty. Poverty is the leading structural risk factor associated with the removal of all children, and particularly First Nations children. The employment rate and employment income rate for Aboriginal people are substantially lower than for non-Aboriginal people. Improving Canadian child tax benefits and employment opportunities are pathways to reducing this structural inequity.</li>
