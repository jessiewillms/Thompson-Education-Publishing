large_image_caption_text: Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde and Cindy Blackstock, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society Executive Director, address the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling regarding discrimination against First Nations children in care. The ruling calls for the redesign of the child welfare system and its funding mode to ensure First Nations are given culturally appropriate services.

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">“There is a need to affirm and support traditional ways of helping that have sustained Aboriginal communities for generations”</p>

	<p>This paper explores how the propensity of social workers to make a direct and unmitigated connection between good intentions, rational thought, and good outcomes forms a white-noise barrier that substantially interferes with our ability to see negative outcomes resulting directly or indirectly from our works. The paper begins by outlining the harm experienced by Aboriginal children, before exploring how two fundamental philosophies that pervade social service practice impact Aboriginal children: 1) an assumption of pious motivation and effect, and 2) a desire to improve others. Finally, the paper explores why binding reconciliation and child welfare are a necessary first step toward developing social work services that better support Aboriginal children and families.</p>

	<p>Social workers have significant impacts on the lives of children and families every day—especially children experiencing maltreatment. The beliefs that we know what good is, are good, and can instill good in others, are so ingrained in the social work fabric that there is little meaningful conversation about our potential to do harm. Even when confronted by graphic evidence of harm arising from social work actions, our historical response has often been to protect ourselves from seeing what we perhaps fear the most—we, the good guys, doing the harm.</p>

	<p>This piece begins by reflecting on social work policies and practices with Aboriginal children that have been termed “poor practice” by many, and “cultural genocide” by some (Balfour, 2004), before urging the social work profession to actively engage in a meaningful process of reconciliation with Aboriginal peoples.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">What’s the Harm?</p>

	<p>Herwitz (2003) argues that the first step in reconciliation is to understand the harm by hearing it in a way that cannot be rationalized or abided. This is a fundamental first step for social work. We must learn from our professional past in order to avoid replicating past mistakes with Aboriginal peoples and other groups. Elder Wilma Guss (2004) suggests that those who did the harm do not have the right to define it or define the solutions to redress it. The definition of harm and the solutions to the harm are the first property of those who experienced it. This piece argues that a lack of knowledge and critical reflection on social work’s role in colonialism erodes our ability to work effectively with Aboriginal peoples and engage in reconciliation.</p>

	<p>Aboriginal peoples have lived on the lands now known as Canada for thousands of years (Muckle, 1999). These diverse and complex societies embrace different linguistic, cultural, political, and spiritual systems reflecting their distinct ecological settings. Despite their diversity, Aboriginal peoples share a common belief in the interdependence of all living, spiritual, and physical forms; a preference for communal rights; and a high regard for knowledge handed down in a sacred trust from one generation to another (Auger, 2001). These beliefs influenced all ways of knowing and being, including systems for caring and educating children and youth (Auger, 2001; Sinclair, Bala, Lilles, and Blackstock, 2004). No society was ever without its challenges, and each community had laws and responses to help children who were receiving inadequate care. These responses included placement of the child with other community members, conflict resolution, and redistribution of community resources to ensure parents could care for their children (Blackstock, 2003). Unlike in today’s social work practice, placement outside of the home never resulted in the complete severance of a parent’s responsibility for the child. Parental roles were simply redefined so that the parent could safely and properly support their child to the degree they were able (Auger, 2001). To my knowledge, no Aboriginal language in Canada has a word for child removal or apprehension as defined in contemporary child welfare law.</p>

	<p>Aboriginal concepts and systems of care sustained generations of Aboriginal children until the British and French arrived on the eastern shores of what is now North America in the late 1400s and early 1500s. At the time, both colonial powers were feudal monarchies interested in expanding their respective empires, with limited compromise or respect for the “savages” who lived on the new lands (Canada, 1996). Although the earliest contact was described as mutually beneficial, as Europeans traded survival information and trade access for goods, it changed when European motivations shifted to settlement and resource extraction. Colonial powers initiated efforts to eradicate the Indians<span class="span--number">2</span> through the intentional introduction of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis, removal of Indians from their traditional lands, imposition of restrictions of Indian movements, reckless harvesting of natural resources, and, upon Confederation, the regulation of Indians and lands reserved for Indians through the federal government’s Indian Act (Canada, 1996).</p>

	<p>Deaths from disease, starvation, and willful murder related to colonization resulted in the complete eradication of some Indian communities, such as the Beothuck of Newfoundland, and an overall 80 percent (approx. 400,000) reduction in the Indian population from the time of contact until 1871 (Canada, 1996). This loss of life was most significantly experienced by Aboriginal children who, along with being the most vulnerable to death by disease, also experienced the profound grief associated with losing so many members of their family and community.</p>

	<p>This harm was compounded by Canada’s introduction of compulsory attendance at residential schools designed to assimilate Indian children and thereby eliminate what senior government officials termed “the Indian problem.”<span class="span--number">3</span> These schools, run by Christian churches and funded by the federal government, operated from the time of Confederation until 1996, when the last one closed in Saskatchewan (Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2003). The Indian Act authorized Indian Agents to remove every Indian child between 5 and 15 years old from their parents’ care and place them in often distant residential schools. The schools themselves were poorly constructed, using the cheapest possible material and workmanship, and thus were prolific incubators for the spread of tuberculosis and smallpox. In fact, Duncan Campbell Scott, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the first three decades of the twentieth century, estimated that up to 50 percent of Indian children died in the schools from disease or maltreatment (Milloy, 1999). The federal government was advised of the problem by Dr. P.H. Bryce, Indian Affairs Medical Officer, as early as 1907, but its efforts to rectify the situation were inadequate and lacked any sustained effort. In fact, the lack of government action motivated Bryce to publish his findings in magazines and newspapers, hoping that the public would become enraged and force the government into positive action. Sadly, despite Bryce’s best efforts, the reports were met with silence and had little effect on government policy and practice (Milloy, 1999). This inaction prompted Queens Council S.H. Blake to note that “in that the government fails to obviate the preventable causes of death, it brings itself in unpleasant nearness to manslaughter” (Milloy, 1999: 77).</p>

	<p>There was child maltreatment as well. Throughout the history of residential schools, dating back as early as 1896, Indian Agents and others advised the federal government of life-threatening incidents of physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and servitude (Canada, 1996; Milloy, 1999). Even after several deaths due to child maltreatment were reported, the federal government and the churches failed to implement measures necessary to protect Indian children (Milloy, 1999). Residential schools began closing in the mid 1940s, with the last federally-run school finally closing its doors in 1996.</p>

	<p>There is very little evidence that the voluntary sector, including human rights groups, did anything significant to disrupt residential schools or the colonial policies of government overall (Blackstock, 2009). Even though children’s aid societies had been operating in Ontario since the early 1900s (Sealander, 2003)—and thus logically must have been aware of Bryce’s frequent public statements about the preventable deaths of children in the schools—there is no record of a children’s aid society ever intervening. Even as reports of abuse and neglect at the schools increased across the country, I know of no records suggesting that children’s aid organizations took note of the reports or did anything meaningful to intervene. A joint submission to the Senate and House of Commons in 1946 by the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) and the Canadian Welfare Council (CWC) indicates that social workers were well aware of the residential schools (Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons, 1946). The CASW and CWC joint submission suggested that Aboriginal peoples should be assimilated into Canadian society, and although shortcomings with the residential schools were acknowledged, the CASW and CWC noted that “[W]e feel they [residential schools] have a place in a well-rounded system of Indian education, particularly insofar as they meet special needs.”<span class="span--number">4</span> Even if one argued that the CASW and CWC did not, for some reason, know about the prolific and preventable deaths from tuberculosis and other factors at the time of their testimony, this was clearly outlined in other parts of the report where their own evidence is reproduced, and yet there is no evidence that the CASW or CWC took up any meaningful campaigns to address the problems.</p>

	<p>To be fair, the CASW and CWC did successfully advocate with the federal government to ensure that child welfare services were provided to Indian children on reserves.<span class="span--number">5</span> However, this advocacy was not accompanied by a persistent campaign to close the residential schools themselves. In fact, social workers were active participants in the placement of Aboriginal children in residential schools as late as the 1960s (Caldwell, 1967; Canada, 1996).</p>

	<p>The professional oversight bodies did not effectively monitor the quality of child welfare services that mainstream social workers began providing on reserves. This lack of invigilation, accompanied by a systemic ignorance of the impacts of colonization, often resulted in the mass removal of Aboriginal children and their placement in non-Aboriginal homes—often permanently (Caldwell, 1967). This pattern of mass removals became known as the “60s scoop.” It was not unusual for so many children to be removed that a bus would be hired by child welfare workers to transport them out of the reserve (Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, 2002).</p>

	<p>Upon completing his investigation into the impacts of the 60s scoop practice on Aboriginal communities in Manitoba, Judge Edwin Kimmelman said that these mass removals amounted to “cultural genocide” (Balfour, 2004). Some provinces and territories responded to Kimmelman’s concerns by setting temporary moratoriums on the adoption of Aboriginal children by non-Aboriginal parents, but little was done to redress the poverty, social exclusion, and impacts of colonization that had resulted in these children being removed from their families in the first place.</p>

	<p>In the early 1980s, the federal government began to respond to First Nations demands to operate their own child welfare programs so they could stem the tide of children leaving the community. These programs, known as First Nations child and family service agencies, operate pursuant to provincial legislation and are funded by the federal government (MacDonald and Ladd, 2000). Although the agencies have made substantial gains in ensuring that services are culturally based and that children are given the best chance to stay in their community, they express concern regarding inequitable funding and the imposition of provincial legislation and standards that have substantially failed Aboriginal children (Blackstock, 2003). A national policy review conducted in 2000 confirmed First Nations concerns that the current funding structure from the federal government does not provide sufficient resources for children to stay safely in their home—although there is no funding cap on resources for children removed from their home (MacDonald and Ladd, 2000). A more recent and detailed analysis found that the funding inequality is in the order of $109 million per annum (Auditor General of Canada, 2008; Loxley et al., 2005). This means that at-home child maltreatment prevention services, which are broadly available to other Canadian children, are not provided to First Nations children on reserve, resulting in an astronomical over-representation of Status Indian<span class="span--number">6</span> children in care (Blackstock, 2009). Child in care data from three provinces indicates that 0.67 percent of non-Aboriginal children were in care as of May 2005, as compared to 10.23 percent of Status Indian children. Overall, Status Indian children were 15 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care than non-Aboriginal children (Blackstock, Prakash, Loxley, and Wien, 2005).</p>

	<p>As Maclean’s magazine (2004) noted, “the numbers of Status Indians taken into care has jumped by 71.5 percent between 1995 and 2001—something experts put down to the general level of poverty and relative underfunding of First Nations child welfare agencies—the situation can only fuel racial inequality and discord. In a verdict shared by adoption advocates across the country, ACC [Adoption Council of Canada] chair Sandra Scarth calls the overall situation ‘appalling’” (Ferguson, 2004).</p>

	<p>By 2007, the federal government had done little to redress the drastic funding shortfalls, prompting the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the federal government’s conscious underfunding of child welfare amounted to racial discrimination within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The federal government did not actively dispute the central claim that child welfare funding is inequitable and yet pursued a plethora of technical objections in an apparent effort to derail or delay the hearing of this important case on its merits (Blackstock, 2009). The case went to trial before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2013 and concluded in the fall of 2014. The Tribunal released its landmark ruling in January of 2016, substantiating the discrimination complaint and ordering the federal government to cease its discriminatory practices (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2016 CHRT 2). Although this case was broadly covered in the Canadian press and the engagement of social workers is growing, support from non-Aboriginal social work organizations was not proportional to the gravity of the injustice at issue in this case.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">Responding to the Harm: The Search for Social Work</p>

	<p>One would think that responding to the needs of First Nations children and families would be a national priority for social work—the reality is that it is not. Whilst social work authorities, academics, and professional bodies acknowledge the over-representation of Aboriginal children in care, they typically devote very limited financial resources or sustained effort to redress it. For example, in 2004 a provincial child welfare authority allocated only 20 percent of its family support budget to Aboriginal families, despite the fact that Aboriginal children comprised over 80 percent of all children in care (Flette, 2005). Another province only placed 2.5 percent of Aboriginal children in care with culturally matched homes, despite a statutory obligation to do so (British Columbia Children’s Commission, 1998). Additionally, although several non-Aboriginal social work regional and national umbrella organizations identify Aboriginal children as an organizational priority, an examination of programs, budgets, and outcomes rarely reflects any significant or sustained focus that is proportionate to the scope of the problem. From a research perspective, investment in national Aboriginal child welfare research is modest, representing approximately $350,000 in 2004, whereas keeping Status Indian children on-reserve in care cost the federal government over $300 million. By 2009, the reality was even more bleak, with a national investment of approximately $100,000, whilst the child welfare expenditures for First Nations children on-reserve had grown to well over $400 million due to rising rates. There are, of course, promising exceptions where social workers and social work organizations have meaningfully worked with First Nations to redress the over-representation of children in care, but these continue to be the exception. These positive examples need to be recognized and supported—but they should spur us on to further progressive action and not reinforce a professional slumber.</p>

	<p>Despite the indications that social work requires a courageous invigilation of its impacts on Aboriginal families, mainstream social work largely considers itself to have taken the steps necessary to insulate itself from its egregious actions of the past. We talk about the residential school and 60s scoop eras as if they were safely packed away. But is this true? Have we as social workers really learned from our past mistakes?</p>

	<p>The following sections explore how professional notions of improvement, professional piety, mandates and borders, and distorted knowledge and culturally appropriate services may have contributed to social work’s unfortunate history with Aboriginal peoples in Canada. This list is not exhaustive and<br />is meant to inspire broad-based conversation to promote<br />professional learning.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Both Sides of Improvement</p>

	<p>The notion of improving other people is endemic to social work. It is a source of both moral nobility and trepidation. It implies an ability to accurately define another’s deficit and to locate its importance in his or her life, and assumes the efficacy of external motivations and sensibilities to change. As interventions with Aboriginal children by non-Aboriginal helping professionals testify, there is a delicate balance between the freedom and dignity of individuals and societies at one end and cultural arrogance and oppression on the other.</p>

	<p>Research suggests that social workers should avoid drumming up solutions to “Aboriginal issues” by themselves and instead invest in a relationship where the right of Aboriginal peoples to make the best decisions affecting them is affirmed and supported. The wisdom of this approach is documented by Chandler and Lalonde (1998), who found that although First Nations children in British Columbia have one of the highest suicide rates in the world, more than 90 percent of the suicides occurred in 10 percent of the province’s First Nations communities. In fact, some First Nations reported a zero percent suicide rate over the 13 years prior to the study. Chandler and Lalonde (1998) wanted to know what differences existed between communities that could account for such a wide variation in suicide rates. Findings indicate that First Nations communities with a low suicide rate or no suicide rate exercised high levels of community-based decision making, as represented by First Nations service delivery in child welfare, health, education, and fire and police services. High levels of female participation in First Nations governments and advancement toward self-government were also factors. The work of Cornell and Kalt (1992) complements Chandler and Lalonde’s findings. They found that communities with sustained socio-economic development also had highly developed community decision-making authorities. They argue that effective capacity building must be preceded by affirmation of Aboriginal decision making. This finding challenges the assumption that Aboriginal peoples must build capacity to have decision making capacity passed to them.</p>

	<p>As Chandler and Lalonde (1998) observe, many Aboriginal communities have systems in place to prevent youth suicide, and these systems are so effective that their youth suicide rates are substantially lower than in non-Aboriginal communities. What is needed is to ensure that other Aboriginal communities have access to the information and resources needed to implement their own solutions.</p>

	<p>This does not mean that non-Aboriginal social service providers get to walk away. As many Elders have said, “We did not get here alone, and we are not leaving alone.” It does mean shifting the philosophy of our current social work practice away from one of solution holder and preferred service delivery agent to one where Aboriginal peoples make the best decisions for themselves. Non-Aboriginal peoples must play a critical and active role in making space for those decisions and in ensuring that adequate resources are available to implement them.</p>

	<p>As the following section argues, it will also require a critical analysis of other factors influencing the profession, such as the assumption of pious motivation and effect.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Understanding the Occasional Evil of Angels</p>

	<p>The assumption of piety in social work blinds us from considering the need for anything along the lines of a Hippocratic Oath. The concept that we can do harm (or even evil) rarely appears on the optical radar screen of professional training, legislation, or practice as anything other than a tangential way through procedural mechanisms such as codes of ethics. This is particularly true for those of us who work with children—believing that those who want to do good and are trained to do good could cause harm to children is astonishing and upsets our sensibility of the world. Talking about it even seems too much, as it breathes life into its possibility so often we are silent.</p>

	<p>On the rare occasions when there are discussions of harm in social work, and in helping professions more broadly, they are predominated by inaccurate assumptions that incidents of harm will be obvious, that harm is done by others, that social workers will act out against it, and that when it does occur we will learn from it. We also wrongly assume that incidents are singular rather than systemic and that codes of ethics, professional training and standards, and anti-oppressive social work paradigms can prevent their insurgence and persistence.</p>

	<p>When evidence surfaces that harm has arisen directly from the actions or inactions of practitioners of social work or of other helping professions, we often default to rationalizing the occurrence as exceptional, using one of these predominant arguments: 1) they acted based on the sensibilities of the day—we know better now; 2) they did not know about the harm; 3) it was outside of their mandate, and; 4) if the harm is so appalling that it cannot be rationalized as coming from a place of good intentions, they were immoral or bad individuals who are exceptions to the group. We have also developed systemic approaches, such as the emphasis on culturally appropriate services, that, whilst holding great promise for supporting Aboriginal families, have also been misused as a means of limiting critical systemic analysis and professional action. This section deconstructs these rationalizations to try to understand why social workers and others have demonstrated very limited, if any, sustained activism against the multiple harms experienced by Aboriginal children.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">Sensibilities of the Day</p>

	<p>Some people rationalize the lack of social work efforts to stop residential schools by noting that child abuse has just recently surfaced on the societal radar screen as a problem deserving attention. The argument goes that “we had different standards back then—no one talked about child abuse” and thus it went unnoticed. But as John Milloy (1999) notes, the reports of child abuse at residential schools were made by people of the period who, given the sensibilities of those times, found the treatment of these children unacceptable. And yet, despite having received the reports, government officials typically did little to stop the abuse, and in some cases the death, of children.</p>

	<p>Today we have a significant evidence base to suggest that Aboriginal children and young people face pervasive risk in a way not experienced by other Canadians, and yet our professional response has been lukewarm (Blackstock, 2009; Blackstock, Clarke, Cullen, D’Hondt, and Formsma, 2004). We are now the people of the period who should find such disproportionate risk unacceptable—but our professional actions are not, in my view, in keeping with the crisis before us. It is as if we have edged our collective tolerance for the risks experienced by Aboriginal children upwards to a degree where it is difficult to imagine what threshold needs to be reached for the profession to take action in a meaningful way.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">We Did Not Know</p>

	<p>Another way to rationalize the mediocre response of social work to residential schools is to argue that information on the deaths and abuse was not widely known until recently. As John Milloy (1999) notes, this argument is weak, as there was significant information on the abuse and deaths of children in residential schools, and this information was available to governments, academics, and the media. Nevertheless, the availability of this information failed to inspire progressive action to redress the abuse and murders at residential schools.</p>

	<p>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (Canada, 1996) found that social workers knew about residential schools and routinely served on admissions committees adjudicating child welfare placements in these schools (ibid.). In addition to serving on placement committees, social workers actually placed substantial numbers of Aboriginal children in residential schools. As the RCAP notes, “residential schools were an available and apparently popular option within the broader child care system” (Canada, 1996, Chapter 10, p.21). According to Caldwell (1967), child welfare placements accounted for over 80 percent of the admissions in six residential schools in Saskatchewan. Caldwell’s report outlines a number of shortcomings in the residential school program but even he, a social worker by training, did not recommend the closure of these schools. Caldwell did, however, go further than most other social workers of his time by recommending improvements to the residential school system.</p>

	<p>The temptation to believe “if we had only known—we would have acted differently” may provide some false comfort, but in the case of the social work profession, it did know and acted largely in complicit support of the residential school system. The application of the “if we only knew, we could act differently” argument has little merit in today’s context as well. Even with multiple sources of information documenting the relationship between structural risks (such as poverty, substance misuse, and poor housing) and child maltreatment (Auditor General of Canada, 2009; Blackstock, 2009; Trocmé, Knoke, &amp; Blackstock, 2004), efforts by social workers and others to prioritize, protest, and redress the harms experienced by Aboriginal children continue to be inadequate and piecemeal.</p>

	<p>We continue to confine our assessments of child risk to the family, which fetters our ability to identify risk factors that impact the child but that have their source outside of the sphere of influence of their parents. We have also done little to address the longstanding inequitable child welfare funding provided to First Nations children on reserves (Blackstock, 2009; First Nations Child and Family Caring Society et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2016 CHRT 2; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2009). In missing these structural risks, we set up a situation where Aboriginal parents are held responsible for things outside of their control, and we deprive Aboriginal families of the same access to services as other Canadians to redress risk to children.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">We Are Needed</p>

	<p>So if information on its own is not enough to mobilize social workers, is it possible that by entrenching in the idea that social workers are positive agents for social well-being, we have unintentionally built a barrier that rebuffs or rationalizes information suggesting we are perpetrating harm? Take, for example, the assumption that social work is in the best position to respond to child maltreatment and neglect in Aboriginal communities. Increasing evidence suggests that Aboriginal communities, when provided with adequate supports, develop the most sustainable socio-economic improvements for children, and yet as a profession we continue to believe, almost at the exclusion of other options, that we are the best response. This should be a touchstone question for our profession, but it is rarely asked. Instead, we are busy developing programs and services to offer abused and neglected children and families instead of providing communities and families with the resources to implement their own best solutions (Blackstock and Trocmé, 2005).</p>

	<p class="text--grey">Mandates and Borders</p>

	<p>Another way of rationalizing the harm is to claim it was outside of the mandate of the various helping professions or organizations to intervene. Take the case of Jordan, a First Nations boy from Norway House Cree Nation who was born in 1999 with complex medical needs. His family placed him in child welfare care—not because he was abused or neglected but because that was the only way the provincial and federal governments would provide the money required for Jordan’s special needs (Lavallee, 2005). (In a policy that baffles common sense, the federal government will not provide adequate support for special needs children on reserve—unless they are in child welfare care.) Shortly after Jordan’s second birthday, doctors agreed to allow him to return home, however, as Noni MacDonald and Amir Attaran (2007) of the Canadian Medical Association Journal note, “bureaucrats ruined it.” Jordan was a First Nations boy whose family lived on reserve, and unfortunately, provincial and federal governments do not agree on who is responsible for payment of services for children on reserve. The standard practice by both levels of government has been to defer or deny First Nations children the government services that are routinely available to other Canadian children until the dispute can be resolved, with little consideration for the child’s safety or well-being. For Jordan, provincial and federal bureaucrats argued over every item related to his at-home care, while he stayed in hospital at about twice the cost (Lavallee, 2005). Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and Jordan saw the seasons change through his hospital window. All the while, bureaucrats met somewhere, likely feeling good about “doing something about Jordan’s situation” while privileging their respective government’s desire to not pick up the tab. It seems that they became ethically blind to Jordan’s fate, and sadly, Jordan died waiting at five years of age, having never spent a day in a family home.</p>

	<p>This sad example shows just how easy it is for something as insignificant as a mandate to overshadow the precious life of a young boy. This astounding story is not unique. A recent study found that in 12 sample First Nations agencies, there were 393 jurisdictional disputes between governments around children’s services in the past year alone (Blackstock, Prakash, Loxley, and Wien, 2005). Governments put their needs ahead of children’s needs far too often. Jordan’s passing prompted the development of Jordan’s Principle, which is a child-first principle aimed at resolving government jurisdictional disputes. It is supported by over 9,900 individuals and organizations, including growing numbers of social work organizations and governments, and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal recently ordered the federal government to immediately cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan’s Principle. However, the reality is that no provincial/territorial or federal government in Canada has fully implemented this principle. I continue to receive reports of First Nations children who are being denied life-saving and wellness government services available to other children because of jurisdictional wrangling.</p>

	<p>I have often wondered what the provincial and federal officials involved were thinking when they allowed Jordan to languish in hospital. I have decided to believe that they were not evil people, and yet their collective actions had devastating consequences for Jordan. I have no good answers, as every rationale I come up that would help me understand what the bureaucrats were thinking seems so very weak in the face of<br />Jordan’s needs.</p>

	<p>Mandates are both a necessary act of pragmatism and a cop- out. They are pragmatic because no profession or institution can manage it all, and they are a cop-out because they allow for inaction in the face of gross and demonstrated immorality. Perhaps part of the reason that good people can do such immoral things in the name of mandates is explained by the work of Zygmunt Bauman (1989), who argues that too often, our personal morality is usurped by our need to comply with what is deemed morally good by the institutions we are affiliated with or work with. He argues that there is a reason why whistle blowers are the exception—because they accomplish what is too rare, to break through the institutional moral code calling for company/professional loyalty to act on the basis of their moral conscience. In social work, we talk about social change, but we do not talk as honestly about how our bureaucracies often prefer conformity versus courageous conversation and innovation in child welfare (Blackstock, 2009). Social change is what we do externally—but not as often internally.</p>

	<p>The power of mandates and borders can also be more subtly shaped by interfaces between our national, professional, and personal ideologies and assumptions, which locate harm outside of what has already been deemed to be good. This partially explains why Canada, considered a bastion of human rights, was able to sign the Universal Declaration on Human Rights in the same year it was operating residential schools, did not recognize Indians as people under the law, and invited South African apartheid delegates to learn about its Indian pass system without any public protest by human rights organizations or institutions. It also partially explains why the government of British Columbia was able to run a referendum on Aboriginal treaty rights in 2002 while refusing to educate the public on the treaty process. This, the first referendum on minority rights, was held with only moderate intervention by human rights groups and only the modest disapproval of the federal government. As these examples illustrate, too often, non-government organizations (NGOs) and human rights organizations do not think to look within Canada for human rights transgressions; instead they focus abroad. As Aziz Choudry explains, “many social justice campaigns, NGOs, and activists in these countries operate from a state of colonial denial and refuse to make links between human rights abuses overseas, economic injustice, and the colonization of the lands and peoples where they live” (Choudry, 2001).</p>

	<p>It is easier to believe that some other society is perpetrating human rights abuses than to believe your own country and society are—because that frames the accountability on a more personal level to either do something or own the responsibility of remaining silent and still. There are few things more courageous than to stand up to people or a government that you respect and care for—especially for an interest outside of oneself. Bryce did it and should be celebrated as one of the great Canadian heroes.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">Evil: A Domain of the Well-Intentioned?</p>

	<p>Another rationalization hinges on the propensity to believe that if we as social workers are well-intended in our actions, we are essentially absolved from moral responsibility, regardless of consequences. As Zygmunt Bauman (1989) notes, the idea that evil is obvious and perpetrated only by bad apples serves to absolve us all of being evil and affords a false security that we will know evil when we see it. As a child-protection worker, I have seen evil in its many faces, and it has rarely been obvious or predictable. It is more often grey than black and white. It can be multi-dimensional, rationalized, normative, and carried out by many instead of one. It often has benefits for someone, and those benefits can seductively legitimize the costs experienced by another. As John Milloy (1999) noted, the motivations of staff at the Department of Indian Affairs and those of the churches were not always evil in the way they understood evil to be—they used words like “civilizing,” “integrating,” and “educating” to describe what they were doing. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples echoes Milloy’s findings, noting that “[P]olitician, civil servant, and perhaps most critically, priest and parson felt that in developing the residential school system, they were responding not only to a constitutional but to a Christian ‘obligation to our Indian Brethren’ that could be discharged only ‘through the medium of children’ and therefore ‘education must be given its foremost place’” (Canada, Chapter 10, p.3). This created a moral cushion that blinded them to the end result of their actions, which some of their contemporaries, such as P.H. Bryce and S.H. Blake, found repugnant if not criminal.</p>

	<p>This moral cushion was strengthened by limited acts that workers carried out to try to redress the harm. These acts were often perfunctory and unmonitored, but served to liberate workers from the moral responsibility to do something. For example, upon hearing reports of child deaths and maltreatment, staffers would often issue edicts that said it was not to happen again, but nothing was done to ensure these edicts were followed up—even in the face of substantial evidence that the abuse was continuing.</p>

	<p>These cushions have served to comfort thousands of Canadians, including those active in human rights, the voluntary sector, and academia who either contributed to the harm or stood silent in its wake. Some lived near the residential schools, some read P.H. Bryce’s article in the magazine <span class="">Saturday Night</span>, and others saw the graveyards on residential school grounds or the buses collecting children from reserves to be placed in foster homes, and yet, except for some courageous instances, there was silence.</p>

	<p>Evil happens in degrees—there are those who beat children to death, those who issued edicts without following up, and those who lived next door and said nothing (Neiman, 2002). Are they all accountable? If so—how, and why? To what standard of courage and compassion should we hold social workers—are we willing to support them when they identify acts that upset our sensibilities, or are we as a society willing to tolerate their silence in the face of atrocities? These are difficult questions that have remained underground in social work and need to be unearthed if we are to deconstruct our professional past in a way that makes obvious the thinking that fuels<br />colonization.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">Culturally-Appropriate Services: A Step Forward?</p>

	<p>In the absence of the recognition of Aboriginal child welfare laws, a subsidiary movement has developed to deliver “culturally-appropriate” services. This sounds good—it feels like we are moving in the right direction as a profession, but the problem is that few of us really understand what being culturally appropriate means. This is partly because few services are analyzed for their underpinning cultural value in order to determine what program elements are culturally predicated and on what culture. Too often, services are proclaimed culturally neutral, often by those whose cultures are embodied in the service, in the absence of any thorough analysis or search for perspective from other cultural groups. In the absence of this analysis, social workers can wrongly assume that nothing needs to be changed about the fundamental elements of the service—it just needs to be made “culturally appropriate” by adding in Aboriginal symbols or ceremonies. I am open to debate on this issue, but in my own experience, I have yet to see a Euro-Western program of any stature deconstructed from a value perspective by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples and then reconstructed on an Aboriginal value base.</p>

	<p>What we do know is that this movement toward culturally-appropriate services has gained increasing authority. Governments are amending their internal operational guidelines and contract service guidelines to require child welfare service providers ensure that Aboriginal children receive culturally-appropriate services. As a result, large numbers of organizations have begun to redefine their services as culturally appropriate. However, as there is an absence of guidelines and monitoring bodies for culturally-appropriate services, what began as an earnest attempt to better support Aboriginal children has largely degenerated into a movement that gains culturally-ascribed organizations social capital and funder recognition without having to critically evaluate the cultural efficacy and relevance of their programs. I argue that the focus on culturally-appropriate services takes attention away from the real need to affirm Aboriginal ways of knowing and caring for children. After all, the basic assumption underlying culturally- appropriate services is that one can adapt a mainstream model for application to Aboriginal children—without compromising the basic integrity of the service—including the values and beliefs that drive it. As Aboriginal values and beliefs respecting children are very divergent from Euro-Western understanding, marrying the two into a coherent and effective program for Aboriginal children is difficult. This difficulty has been well recorded by Aboriginal child welfare agencies, who describe the problems inherent in delivering child welfare services to Aboriginal children within the realm of Euro-Western legislation. Until there are effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms developed to measure the efficacy of culturally-appropriate services, we need to be vigilant about the usage of such terms and any conclusions we may draw between said services and the well-being of Aboriginal children.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Reconciliation and Social Work</p>

	<p>After former Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s apology for the wrongs done by the Government of Canada during the residential school era, reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians sounds like just the thing social work should be involved in—and it should. But not before it courageously engages in reconciliation itself. This means that social work must look in the professional mirror to see its history from multiple perspectives, including the perspectives of those who experienced the harm. We must look beyond our need to not feel blamed so we can learn and change our behaviour. It sounds trivial to write about the power of blame and shame among social workers, but I have seen its power. I have seen many bright and compassionate non-Aboriginal social workers raise walls of rationalization and distance to insulate themselves from it. As ostensible doers of good, we have not been trained to stand in the shadow of our harmful actions, so we ignore or minimize them. It is a privilege to put up those walls—to be able to insulate yourself from what happened. When Aboriginal people put up the walls, they are left alone to deal with the harm. When social workers put up the walls, they can pretend the pain does not exist at all and go about their daily business. The problem is that putting up the walls does not change the reality—Aboriginal peoples lost in colonization and social work did, too.</p>

	<p>Social work misplaced its moral compass and in doing so perpetrated preventable harms to Aboriginal children. It denied itself the opportunity to learn from Aboriginal cultures and make a meaningful contribution to the safety and well-being of Aboriginal children. As social workers, we must understand that our failure to engage in an internal process of reconciliation has immobilized our strength and efficacy.</p>

	<p>It is not enough to issue a statement on Aboriginal peoples from time to time or tinker with services if what social workers really want are justice, respect, and equality for Aboriginal children and young people. We must courageously redefine the profession using reconciliation processes and then move outward to expand the movement into society. In 2005, over 200 Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal experts in child welfare came together to develop a process for reconciliation in child welfare and five principles to guide the process, known as Reconciliation in Child Welfare: Touchstones of Hope for Indigenous Children, Youth, and Families (Blackstock et. al., 2006). The reconciliation process is described as having four phases (truth telling, acknowledging, restoring, and relating) and five principles to guide the process (self-determination, holistic approach, structural interventions, culture and language, and non-discrimination). The Touchstone principles are constitutional in nature in that they are intended to be interpreted by both Aboriginal peoples and social workers within the context of the unique culture of different Aboriginal groups. To be effective, entire systems of child welfare need to engage in the process and embed the principles in all aspects of the work. To date, a number of First Nations and provincial state child welfare authorities in the U.S. and Canada have begun implementing the Touchstone framework, but social work more broadly has done little to embed the Touchstones process in its own work.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Conclusion</p>

	<p>So although there has been some marginal progress, the lived experience of Aboriginal children and youth in Canada continues to be predominated by social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression. The significant body of evidence regarding the disproportionate risk faced by Aboriginal children has been inadequate to motivate social workers and social work organizations to implement the many solutions proposed by Aboriginal peoples. Nor has it promoted substantial internal reflection within social work or other helping professions on what our role has been in perpetrating the harm and our consequential responsibility to understand and reconcile the harm. There is a need to affirm and support the traditional ways of helping that have sustained Aboriginal communities for generations.</p>

	<p>I look forward to a time when talking about justice for Aboriginal peoples is no longer an unusual or courageous conversation but is instead one that is encouraged and recognized by all Canadians as being important and necessary to affirm our national values of freedom, democracy, justice, and equality; a time when the conversation of reconciliation is just as likely to be initiated by non-Aboriginal people as by Aboriginal people themselves. This will only occur when we as Canadians share what Michael Walzer (1983) describes as a “collective consciousness.” When we can create a common understanding of culture, history, and language through conversation and political action, we can then challenge the inconsistencies in our professional social work values and concepts of justice. This will ensure that democracy, freedom, and equality become the real experience of every Canadian—not just a privileged few standing on one side of a one-way mirror of justice (Blackstock,&#160;2003).</p>

	<p>To get there, we must collectively call out the legislation, values, regulations, systems, and actions that perpetuate colonization and its concordant impacts on Aboriginal children and their families, including those harmful and colonial philosophies and practices that are embedded in social work itself. It means understanding the harm from those who experienced it; it means setting aside the instinct to rationalize it or to turn away from it because it is too difficult to hear—or because we feel blamed. It means having conversations about some of the basic values and beliefs that shape our concepts of social work. It means working with, versus working for, Aboriginal peoples. It means understanding that good intentions and conviction are not enough; it is our actions that are most important. It is about embedding the reconciliation process set out in the Touchstones of Hope document throughout the social work profession.</p>

	<p>Most of all, it means not standing still—or moving just a little; it means social work taking the long journey of reconciliation. And as we walk and grow tired of the journey, let the images of children like Jordan flash across our consciousness and urge us firmly forward.</p>
