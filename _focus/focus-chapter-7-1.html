<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Everyone can do their part to eradicate myths and negative stereotypes</p>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles for anyone suffering from mental illness is overcoming the stigma. Across Canada, many individuals, organizations, and initiatives are striving to decrease stigma in relation to mental health.</p>

<p>For example, Stop the Stigma is a partnership between the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario and the Toronto District School Board that trains students to serve as leaders during mental health awareness weeks in their schools. Students give presentations on topics such as youth mental health and how to access support services.</p>

<p>As another example, the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario has implemented an initiative called Sound Off (Turtert, 2014). This campaign was founded by University of Toronto student Mona Abadi in 2011, in an attempt to reach out to youth across Ontario to create open discussions surrounding mental health. The goal was to give youth an opportunity to share their stories and have their voices heard in a public forum.</p>

<p>The Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) strongly advocates for the abolition of stigma within the context of mental health. In June 2012, the MHCC and the World Psychiatric Association hosted the fifth international conference on stigma reduction, titled “Together against Stigma: Changing How We See Mental Illness.”</p>

<p>The largest stigma-related event ever, the conference invited 670 researchers, practitioners, policy makers, advocates, caregivers, and people with lived experience to Ottawa to share research, programs, best practices, and personal stories. The conference’s main purpose was to encourage citizens everywhere to talk about how to bring about positive change in the way people view mental illness.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Bell’s “Let’s Talk” Campaign</p>

<p>Stigma is the number one reason why two thirds of those living with a mental illness do not seek help. Bell Canada’s“Let’s Talk” is a multi-year charitable program dedicated to mental health. Bell has committed over $100 million to support a wide range of mental health organizations, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. (Bell Let’s Talk, 2015).</p>

<p>Talking is the first step toward creating meaningful change and building greater awareness, acceptance, and action.</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Language matters.</span> Pay attention to the language being used around you. Explain to people that labelling individuals who are dealing with mental health issues as “psycho” or “crazy” has detrimental effects. Suggest alternative language that is more respectful of others.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Educate yourself.</span>Learn the facts about myths that exist concerning mental health to help combat stigma.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Be kind.</span> Small gestures can have a huge impact. Advocate for people who are being labelled, mistreated, or cyber-bullied. Treat people who suffer from mental illness like you would treat others who have different illnesses.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Listen and ask.</span> Sometimes people just need to be heard. Do not minimize or trivialize someone’s illness. Try to empathize.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Talk about it.</span> Have a dialogue, not a debate. Break the silence; mental health affects everyone involved and is not confined to the person who is experiencing mental health issues. Sharing stories of lived experiences is one of the best ways to help eradicate stigma. Support mental health and anti-stigma programs within your community.</li>
