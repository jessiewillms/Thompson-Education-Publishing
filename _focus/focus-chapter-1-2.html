	<p>Today, many Canadian social workers are members of public sector unions. Indeed, the social work profession was part of the wider unionization of the public sector during the 1960s and 1970s, when, for the first time, public sector employees were permitted to join a union.</p>

	<p>There was some debate over whether social workers should unionize, since social workers had their own professional associations and trade unions were traditionally associated with industrial workers. This matter was resolved by a division of labour. The associations represent social workers on issues pertaining to the development of the profession, education of members, and in social issues and social policy. The unions represent them in the areas of pay and working conditions. The associations and the unions in effect complement each other and both have mandates to act for those they represent.</p>

	<p>According to 2008 Service Canada data, 69 percent of social workers belong to unions, compared with 32 percent for all occupations. Forty-five percent of community and social service workers are unionized. The largest unions representing social workers are the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). CUPE members are represented by provincial level divisions and sectors. For example, CUPE Ontario is broken down into five sectors: municipal, health care, school boards, university and social services. Social workers in children&rsquo;s aid societies, community living, children&rsquo;s care centres, municipal social services, community agencies (such as women&rsquo;s shelters), and municipal and charitable homes for the aged are all unionized.</p>

	<p>Social workers have benefited from unions in ways similar to other workers. Unions have helped to raise salaries, improve working conditions, and enhance job security. Pressure from female social workers and from the broader women&rsquo;s movement has encouraged the unions to address important issues such as equal pay, child care, maternity leave, pensions, and sexual harassment.</p>

	<p>Unions in social work agencies have also played another important role that is less well recognized. Labour unions have, throughout history, advocated for improved social programs, income security, and social services. Programs such as Employment Insurance and medicare would not exist today without pressure from the labour sector. As these programs come under increasing pressure from funding cuts, the unions are again playing a key role in opposing cutbacks.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Salaries of Social Workers</p>

	<p>Historically, social workers were among the lowest-paid service workers. Over the past ten years, the profession has enhanced its prominence through the establishment of provincial regulatory bodies called colleges. They regulate practice and control the qualifications necessary to enter the profession. This has brought credibility and growth to the profession.</p>

	<p>Over the past decade, the number of social workers has risen sharply. This can be attributed to expansion in the range of services undertaken by social workers and the intensity of needs. According to 2015 Service Canada data, the average annual employment growth rate was 2.5 percent for social work, compared to 0.8 percent for all other occupations. This trend is expected to continue.</p>

	<p>According to 2015 Service Canada data, 84.5 percent of social workers are women (compared to 48.1 percent for all others), and 84.4 percent work full time (compared to 81.2 percent for all others). The proportion of women in the profession has grown. According to census data, women held approximately 80 percent of social work jobs in 2006, a slightly higher proportion than in 1991 (73 percent). This proportion should continue to grow slightly over the next few years, since women make up between 80 and 90 percent of bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degree graduates. Social workers no longer languish near the bottom of the income scale, with the annual average income topping $52,000, compared with $50,300 for all other occupations.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Qu&eacute;bec Distinction</p>

	<p>A distinction must be drawn between social workers as defined by the National Occupational Classification (NOC) and those who are members of the Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et des th&eacute;rapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Qu&eacute;bec. The NOC numbers include many social workers who are not members of the Qu&eacute;bec Ordre.</p>

	<p>This situation should change in the coming years, however, owing to the passage in 2009 of Bill 21 on the modernization of professional practices in mental health and human relations. This legislation limits previously unregulated practices to designated professionals only. Thus, a large number of human relations officers and community organizers who did not belong to the Ordre can be expected to join it in the near future. As well, the number of members of the Ordre increased by over 30 percent in 2012&ndash;2013, due largely to Bill 21.</p>
