<p>Patti Laboucane-Benson (pictured on the right) is a Métis woman and Director of Research, Training, and Communication at Native Counselling Services of Alberta (NCSA). She has a Ph.D. in Human Ecology, focusing on Aboriginal Family Resilience. For more than 20 years, she has researched the healing and reconciliation of gang-affiliated and incarcerated Aboriginal men. Here, she explores how reclaiming and building on a traditional Indigenous world view can provide a practice model informing historic-trauma healing programs for Aboriginal offenders.</p>

<p>A world view is the overall perspective from which one sees, experiences, and interprets the world. As one example of an Indigenous world view, Cree beliefs about creation teach that the Creator gave the people sacred gifts as a result of the sacred relationship between the people and the Creator. The first gifts were physical in nature and included the people, land, animals, and plants. The second gifts were metaphysical in nature, including the laws, rules, and values that guide our many relationships. These laws include the irrefutable laws of nature, as well as the Creator’s laws that govern relationships between all things (wahkohtowin) and the laws that direct us to have good relationships between people. Living within the boundaries of these laws will ensure that the people feel safe, secure, and able to live “the good life.” These laws are informed by and based upon the values that were gifted to the people. The most common values that are referred to are kindness, caring, sharing, respect, humility, honesty, and&#160;freedom.</p>

<p>The spiral is used as a symbol of the Cree interconnected world view and the nature of the relationship between the people and all of the beings in their world view. The spiral is supported and is kept beautiful and whole by the strength of the rules that govern the relationships, represented by the spaces between the rings. By observing the rules of wahkohtowin and Natural Laws, the people keep in place the scaffolding that ensures we have equality, harmony, and balance in all relationships throughout the spiral.</p>

<p>Indeed, this spiral is the actualization of the best possible life we can attain. The ongoing act of building, strengthening, and renewing our relationships is thus the essence of seeking the good life.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Colonial Policies of Domination and Assimilation</p>

<p>Colonial policies have caused chaos in many Aboriginal communities across Canada and, for the Cree, have disrupted the teaching of wahkohtowin. The result has been devastating, leaving Indigenous people feeling disenfranchised and&#160;demoralized.</p>

<p>Between 1763 and 1867, the concept of Indian Nations as autonomous political entities began to give way to legislation that focused on usurping the power to define who was Indian and who could live on Indian reserves, as well as on the “civilization,” control, and assimilation of the First Peoples. Acts of government legislated the inferior status of Indian identity—an assault on the Aboriginal psyche that created an environment whereby only Indians who renounced their communities, cultures, and languages could gain the respect of colonial (the Crown) and later Canadian society. By the time Confederation occurred, control over all Aboriginal peoples and their lands had been transferred to the office of the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs.</p>

<p>In 1876, the first Indian Act was passed. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples concluded that, “while protection remained a policy goal, it was no longer collective Indian tribal autonomy that was protected: it was the individual Indian recast as a dependent ward—in effect, the child of the state.” The Indian Act was amended in 1884 to protect Indians from their own cultures, prohibiting ceremonies such as the Potlach and the Tamanawas dance, and, later, the Sundance.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Impact of Colonization—Historic Trauma</p>

<p>For the Cree, colonization has had devastating, pervasive, and multi-dimensional effects. Colonization has interfered with the creation of a positive Cree identity, both individually and as a collective. Many Aboriginal, First Nations, and Métis children have been raised in environments that reinforce the inferior status of Aboriginal identity, creating a deep shame in or denial of being an Aboriginal person. Many live in impoverished families that are still burdened by the intergenerational transmission of family violence and by parents who are the third and fourth generation of survivors raised “in the system” with very little knowledge of how to be parents. The loss of connection and communication between children and their parents and grandparents has severely damaged these essential family relationships, blocking the transmission of cultural, ethical, and normative knowledge between generations.</p>

<p>The image shown here is a spiral, illustrating an interconnected world view that was supported by the Cree teachings of wahkohtowin and Natural Law. When the Cree people were prevented from teaching these values, rules, and way of life, the scaffolding that ensured healthy, respectful relationships was severely damaged, and the spiral collapsed upon itself; the critical relational boundaries were transgressed.</p>

<p>For some families and communities, the spiral has become a tangled, chaotic knot. The intergenerational effect of colonial policies is a pervasive sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and powerlessness. As a result, Aboriginal people remain over-represented in the child welfare, justice, and correctional systems in Canada.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Programs to Promote Healing from Historic Trauma</p>

<p>Effective correctional policies can be an important aspect of the untangling of the chaotic spiral. Drawing on the Indigenous model of building family and community resilience, the process must include three interconnected dimensions: (1)&#160;reclaiming our wahkohtowin (an interconnected world view); (2) reconciling our damaged relationships; and (3)&#160;repatriating the power to respectfully self-determine.</p>

<p>The cornerstone to recovering an interconnected world view is the reclamation of our ceremonies as an educational instrument. Within the correctional institutions, Elders’ ceremonies are the milieu in which traditional teachings are imparted in the context of prayer and connectedness to the land and the cosmos. Indeed, the work of the Elders in correctional institutions and community correctional centres is one of the most effective strategies to build a positive sense of Aboriginal identity and develop pro-social values in Aboriginal offenders.</p>

<p>Furthermore, effective healing programs need to be offered in the institutions that deal specifically with historic trauma. If correctional programs are developed in collaboration with Aboriginal peoples, grounded in the world view of local Aboriginal peoples and taking into account the effects of historic trauma, the core criminogenic issues can be addressed. The voicelessness and powerlessness of Aboriginal peoples can only be transformed through dialogue and relationship. While there will always be differences in opinions, common ground in our collective beliefs and goals is achievable and can drive the development of programs that will make a significant difference in the lives of Aboriginal offenders and, eventually, their families.</p>
