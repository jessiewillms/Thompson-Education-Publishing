	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">From Church domination to secular bureaucratization</p>

	<p>From the early part of the seventeenth century to the 1960s, health and social services for the large francophone majority of Québec were operated and often controlled by the Catholic Church. Services for the much smaller anglophone minority were offered by Protestant, Jewish, or lay organizations. Most schools in Québec were either staffed by religious orders or had a significant presence of these orders.</p>

	<p>All of this changed in the 1960s when Québec entered a period known as the Quiet Revolution.</p>

	<p>This period was marked by a radical transformation of Québec society as the state took control of health and social services. Nevertheless, to understand the history of social work in Québec, one needs to look first at the role played by the Catholic Church.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Canada’s First Social Worker?</p>

	<p>The first services provided to French settlers were developed by someone who has been called Canada’s first social worker (Yelaja, 1985). Marguerite Bourgeoys (1620–1700) was a native of Troyes, France. In 1640, she joined an organization of women tasked with educating poor girls, whose families could not afford to send them to live with and be educated by the cloistered nuns at the monastery. The director of this group of teachers was the sister of the Sieur de Maisonneuve, who had founded Ville-Marie (now Montréal) in 1642.</p>

	<p>Because she was a layperson and not a cloistered nun, Marguerite was chosen to accompany de Maisonneuve back to Montréal. She arrived in New France in 1653 with a personal mission to educate children and, in 1658, she opened a girls’ school in an abandoned stable.</p>

	<p>In addition to teaching, Marguerite provided support to <span class="CharOverride-2">les filles du roi,</span> or “the daughters of the king,” orphaned girls who had been sent from France to marry French settlers. She also founded a community of non-cloistered women (the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montréal), and opened a girls’ boarding school in Montréal, a school for Indigenous youth, and a school to teach home economics to young women.</p>

	<p>Marguerite devoted her life to promoting education and social support to French settlers and earned the title of the patron saint of Québec educators. After a long illness, she died in Montréal in 1700. She was beatified in 1950 and canonized in 1982 (Stanké, 1987).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Pre-Confederation Health and Social Services</p>

	<p>Before Confederation, Québec’s population was concentrated in the rural areas along the shores of the St. Lawrence River. An informal support system in rural villages was well established. In times of need, people were expected to turn first to their families, followed by their parish, and, in extreme cases, to the state. During this period, the population did not see a need for a profession such as social work. However, this did not mean that rural families were not in need of help in one form or another. Fecteau (1989) points out that famine and epidemics, for example, were a normal part of people’s lives.</p>

	<p>During these early years, Québec modelled its programs for needy citizens after those in France, which included three types of institutions:</p>
		
		<ul class="ul--chart">
			<li class="li--bullet">the Hôtels-Dieu, which took care of sick people who had no families;</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">the Hôtels-généraux, which looked after poor homeless people; and</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">les bureaux des pauvres, which were established in Québec City, Montréal, and Trois Rivières. These “offices of the poor” were supervised by a priest who organized periodic collections and then distributed the funds to the needy (Ives, Denov, and Sussman, 2015).</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Another charitable organization imported from France was the St. Vincent de Paul Societies. These societies were first established in Québec City in 1846 and spread throughout the province, providing support to poor people, elderly individuals, migrants, and orphans (Ives et al., 2015).</p>

	<p>The role of the Catholic Church in Québec during this early period, however, is still a matter of debate. Some historians remain convinced that the Church was responsible for all programs and services, but Mayer (2002) cautions that, while it did have an influential role and provided most of the direct services, it did not have complete autonomy. Many of the activities of the Church in providing assistance were controlled by the state through a variety of laws.</p>

	<p>Fecteau (1989) also argues that the Catholic Church played a less important role than is commonly believed. According to Fecteau, the lower clergy would have filled the role of informants about the level of poverty but would not normally have provided direct support, such as financial assistance or food. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Church played an important role in the practice and the evolution of social work (van de Sande, Beauvolsk, and Renault, 2011).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">From Confederation to the Depression</p>

	<p>Canada after Confederation was characterized by rapid industrialization. As was the case elsewhere in Canada, the urban population in Québec saw rapid growth, particularly in Montréal. This growth was based on two factors: immigration and internal migration. The rural villages were abandoned for work opportunities in factories located in the large urban centres. Working conditions were very difficult. The workers, including children, put in long hours at very low wages and without protection against disease or work-related accidents.</p>

	<p>It was not until the early 1930s, during the Great Depression, that social work as a profession appeared in French Canada. The working conditions of the lower class had already attracted the attention of the affluent class, mostly women, who worked as volunteers and provided assistance to poor families. These women, who were the forerunners of professional social workers, based their charitable activities on the belief that the poor were in their situation because of moral and spiritual weakness (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>

	<p>In 1934, through the efforts of l’Abbé Charles-Édouard Bourgeois, the first social work agency opened its doors in Trois Rivières, Québec. It was operated by the Catholic Diocese of the region of Trois Rivières and became a model for agencies across the province (Ives et al., 2015).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Birth of a Profession</p>

	<p>The needs of poor and destitute people during the Depression were so great, however, that they overwhelmed the capacity of these early social workers. It became apparent that paid professionals with special training were needed. The only professional training available at that time was at the Montréal School of Social Work at McGill University, an English institution. Because of the belief that the School of Social Work at McGill was based on a Protestant philanthropic and neutral perspective, a francophone Québecer wishing to study there needed special permission from the Archbishop (Groulx,&#160;1983).</p>

	<p>The first person to take the initiative to develop a francophone school of social work was Sister Marie Gérin-Lajoie. Having been influenced by Mary Richmond and the Charity Organisation Society, as well as by Jane Addams and the settlement house movement, Sister Marie Gérin-Lajoie was the first French-Canadian woman to receive a university degree. She went on to study social work at Columbia University in New York City. In 1922 she founded the Institut Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil for women interested in Catholic social work practice. The Institute conferred its first social work diploma in 1934 (Mayer, 2002).</p>

	<p>In large part because Gérin-Lajoie was a woman and did not have the support of the clergy, the Institute was not well accepted by the Québec establishment. It was left to l’Abbé Lucien Desmarais to open the first school of social work in 1940. This school was annexed to the University of Montréal in 1942. A year later, Laval University opened its school of social work. During this period, social work schools and agencies were heavily influenced by Catholic values, and the main intervention approach was “casework,” which was primarily based on a Freudian theoretical orientation (Mayer, 2002).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The “Hands-Off” Approach of Maurice Duplessis</p>

	<p>The 1940s and 1950s in Québec were designated as <span class="CharOverride-2">la grande noirceur,</span> “the great darkness” (Mayer, 2002: 212). Québec was under the control of the National Union government of Maurice Duplessis (shown here), premier from 1944 to 1959. While the federal government in Ottawa used the report published in 1943 by Leonard Marsh as a model for the development of the Canadian version of the welfare state, the Québec government chose to go in the opposite direction, favouring a “laissez-faire” approach to the economy and to social security (Vaillancourt, 1988). Supported by the alliance between the Québec establishment and the Catholic Church, the Duplessis government believed that the responsibility for the poor rested with municipalities and parishes, and not with the provincial government (Mayer, 2002).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Revolutionary 1960s</p>

	<p>As stated earlier, everything changed during the 1960s, when Québec experienced its Quiet Revolution. The state took back control of health and social services, and the Catholic Church lost much of its influence. The professionalization of social work was strengthened by the creation of <span class="CharOverride-2">la Corporation des travailleurs sociaux professionnels du Québec</span> in 1958. The organization was legally incorporated in 1960 (van de Sande et al., 2011) and is now known as<span class="CharOverride-2"> l’Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et des thérapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Québec</span>.</p>

	<p>The <span class="CharOverride-2">Castonguay-Nepveu Report,</span> published in 1971, provided a blueprint for the complete reorganization of health and social services. During this period, three other events contributed to the professionalization of social work: 1) the creation of the Ministry of Social Affairs in 1970, 2) the adoption of the act respecting health and social services (Bill 65) in 1971, and 3) the establishment of the new public health system and social services of Québec in 1972 (Mayer, 2002).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Recent Decades of Cutbacks</p>

	<p>The 1960s and 1970s were characterized by an interventionist policy on the part of Québec in the field of health and social services, but the decades since then have seen a complete reorganization of the “welfare state” and major cutbacks in services. Successive recessions (for example, the oil crisis of 1973 and the economic crisis of 1981) and inflation combined with stagnation convinced governments in Ottawa and Québec that poverty and unemployment are influenced by global economic factors and that government intervention alone will not solve these problems.</p>

	<p>The government’s priority was to make the economies of Canada and Québec more competitive in the face of a growing deficit. This was done through budget cuts to social programs, cuts to unemployment insurance benefits and social assistance, and tax cuts. The federal government in Ottawa significantly reduced its contributions to provincial programs, including health, education, and housing, forcing the provinces to transfer financial responsibility for programs such as child care and housing to municipalities or individuals.<br />These “neo-liberal” measures did result in reduced government deficits and a more competitive economy, but also caused considerable increases in poverty and unemployment levels (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>

	<p>The economic and social policies of Québec and Canada during this period significantly impacted the practice of social work. While the literature reflected an exploration of alternative approaches based on Marxist and feminist principles, the daily practices in state-regulated agencies, such as those for the protection of children and young offenders, were characterized by more bureaucratic control. In Québec, the Rochon Commission was very critical of the functioning of health and social services. Several measures were proposed to make these programs operate more efficiently (Mayer, 2002). Meanwhile, community organizations saw their budgets cut or redirected. Inevitably, many began to take short-term, task-oriented approaches to counselling (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>

	<p>Since 2000, previous reforms have continued, fostering the emergence of new service arrangements. In 2001, the Clair Commission published its report on the functioning of the health and social services and made recommendations for better “governance” of the network, with increased pressure to privatize health services (Mayer, 2002). The great reform of 2004 was another important turning point, which saw the creation of health and social service centres and transformed the relationship between social and medical professions. This new streamlining took place across the province and resulted in a merger of institutions. Health and social service programs were grouped by region or sub-region and administered by one body (Rondeau and Commelin, 2005). The impact of these reforms on the profession of social work in Québec has not been entirely positive. According to Carignan (2014), the Québec government has made a concerted effort to bureaucratize and de-professionalize social work, resulting in a loss of its professional autonomy. Carignan adds that social workers in Québec are now faced with having their practice regulated by a set of very specific competencies.</p>

	<p>Social work and social services in Québec have evolved dramatically since colonial days, when they were dominated by the Catholic Church. The 1960s and 1970s brought the Quiet Revolution, an era of state intervention which saw the Church’s influence decline. This was followed by a reduction of state-sponsored programs, a bureaucratization of the social work profession, and an off-loading of services to the private sector. Clearly, social work in Québec has gone through tremendous change. It will continue to evolve, and despite its challenges, it has earned recognition as an essential part of the health and social services system in Québec.</p>
