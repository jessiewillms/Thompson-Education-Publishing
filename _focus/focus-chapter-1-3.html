	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">A decolonial pedagogy will ensure that we not only talk the talk of social justice, but that we lace up our metaphorical moccasins and walk the talk as well</p>

	<p>In 2004, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;Aboriginal Social Work Education in Canada: Decolonizing pedagogy for the seventh generation,&rdquo; and in this updated revision I include two key changes. First, I changed the term &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; to &ldquo;Indigenous.&rdquo; This is a significant shift as it reflects the evolution of Indigenous social work in the last decade. The original term &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; is the constitutionally recognized term for Indigenous peoples in Canada. Using the term &ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo; in some ways represents a reclaiming of Indigenous identity because it is a self-identified and applied term. Its dictionary meaning is &ldquo;native to,&rdquo; which is appropriate in relation to First Peoples in North America and elsewhere. The term is also non-specific. It can serve to remind us that there are over 600 Indigenous communities speaking over 60 Indigenous languages in Canada. Thus, when we reflect upon Indigenous peoples and issues, we must ask, &ldquo;To which nation are we referring?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Second, I changed &ldquo;Decolonizing&rdquo; to &ldquo;Decolonial&rdquo; pedagogy. &ldquo;Decolonial&rdquo; refers to the critical analysis and practical options that arise from critiquing and separating from the &ldquo;colonial matrix of power.&rdquo; Walter Mignolo (2011) explains this matrix as the colonial &ldquo;racial and patriarchal foundation of knowledge&rdquo; upon which Western social, political, and economic structures are based. Decolonial thinking and doing in social work require us to critique colonialism in Canada. This means analyzing the social, political, and economic incentives behind, for example, the slaughter of the buffalo, the killing of Inuit sled dogs, and the residential school system. Decolonial &ldquo;doing&rdquo; requires us to take action. Indigenous social work is a decolonial approach because it is based on critical analysis of colonial history and its consequences. Its intention is to foster effective practice to alleviate the harms caused by colonialism and to confront its contemporary manifestions (known as &ldquo;neocolonialism&rdquo;). These include ongoing systemic inequities, oppression, discrimination, and racism.</p>

	<p>But decolonial pedagogy goes further. It asserts traditional knowledge and tribal wisdom&mdash;which existed long before Western social work&mdash;as the theoretical, philosophical, and</p>

	<p>practice bases for social work education. Examples of decolonial pedagogy include Kathy Absolon&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Navigating the Landscape of Practice: Dbaagmowin of a Helper&rdquo; (2009); Cindy Baskin&rsquo;s book Strong Helpers&rsquo; Teachings: The Value of Indigenous Knowledges in the Helping Professions (2012); Jacquie Green&rsquo;s narrative about the significance of Oolichan fishing for the Haisla in her chapter &ldquo;Gyawaglaab (Helping One Another): Approaches to best practice through teachings of Ooolichan fishing&rdquo; (2009); and Renee Linklater&rsquo;s book Decolonizing Trauma Work: Indigenous Stories and Strategies. These works, among many others, demonstrate how Indigenous knowledge and wisdom can inform and shape social work theory and practice. Indigenous social work has come a long way in a short period of time!</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Origins of Indigenous Social Work Education</p>

	<p>Indigenous social work emerged from the Indigenous social movement of the 1970s that was sparked by the social revolution of the 1960s. In Canada, this movement saw the implementation of the Bill of Rights and the Indigenous franchise. Indigenous social work evolved in response to our Elders&rsquo; call for social work that was sociologically relevant to Indigenous peoples. Recognizing that Western-trained social workers might be unable to meet the needs of the Indigenous population, several Indigenous social work programs were initiated in the early 1970s. One of the first was the First Nations University of Canada (formerly the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College) School of Indian Social Work, established in 1974. Currently, there are several Indigenous undergraduate social work programs, as well as three Indigenous M.S.W. programs. In addition, many Canadian universities offer Indigenous specializations.</p>

	<p>In 2015, the student caucus of the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE) moved that all schools of social work in Canada include mandatory Indigenous social work classes at the B.S.W. and M.S.W. levels. The motion was passed unanimously by representatives of all accredited social work schools in Canada.</p>

	<p>Since 1974, Indigenous social work has evolved: it draws upon generalist theory and practice while paying particular attention to colonial history and its traumatic outcomes. Social work education&rsquo;s theoretical foundation is tribal knowledge and wisdom. Indigenous social work aims to train both Indigenous and non-Indigenous social workers so that they understand colonial history, its intergenerational and contemporary effects on Indigenous peoples, and how to best practise social work with Indigenous peoples.</p>

	<p>Contemporary generalist cross-cultural approaches and anti-oppressive social work education are valuable in and of themselves. However, Indigenous peoples require social work praxis (theory and practice) that go deeper. Generalist social work does not focus sufficiently on Indigenous issues. Also, the social work profession and social work education have not been free from colonial influence. In the words of Brazilian activist and educator Paulo Freire (2001), &ldquo;the social worker, as much as the educator, is not a neutral agent, either in practice or in action.&rdquo; Indeed, many early social work practices were complicit with government colonial actions and those who protested were silenced (Moran, 1992).</p>

	<p>When Indigenous peoples began to protest the residential schools system and the schools began to close due to disrepair in the late 1950s, the child welfare system suddenly emerged. It led, almost overnight, to the over-representation of Indigenous children in the child welfare system that we see today. Social work was responsible for child welfare apprehensions of Indigenous children who were transracially adopted or institutionalized in long-term foster care. We refer to this period as the &ldquo;Sixties Scoop&rdquo; (Johnston, 1983), and Dr. Lauri Gilchrist has termed the post-1990 ongoing over-representation the &ldquo;Millennium Scoop.&rdquo; </p>

	<p>The numbers of Indigenous children being adopted out via the foster care system are still high. Because of policy and legal mechanisms, we are in a period that I refer to as the &ldquo;Foster Care Scoop.&rdquo; Indigenous peoples have long decried child removal as genocidal&mdash;the deliberate destruction of Indigenous culture.</p>

	<p>The social work profession is beginning to account for its role in colonialism and to contribute to a decolonial pedagogy. This involves going beyond theoretical understandings of inequity and recognizing that Indigenous systems of knowledge and action can guide mainstream social work education and practice. However, we must first be willing to accept that other epistemologies, or world views, exist. Karen Martin (2003) describes epistemology as &ldquo;ways of knowing, doing, and being&rdquo; in the world. These ways of knowing, being, and doing reflect a nation&rsquo;s philosophies and ethics. These in turn shape how families, communities, and institutions operate. By extension, world views also inform how we operate in the helping fields.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Indigenous Ethics</p>

	<p>Indigenous epistemology includes two key principles: the ethic of relationality and the ethic of reciprocity. You may have heard of the Indigenous concept of &ldquo;All My Relations.&rdquo; This term refers to the ethic of relationality. Thomas King (1990) describes this ethic as the recognition of our commonality as humans, and our connectedness to all life forms, including the Earth. (See the quotation below.) This ethic imposes upon us the responsibility to treat each other and the world in the way we would treat our closest relative.</p>

	<p>The second principle is the ethic of reciprocity. This ethic refers to the concept of balance through giving and receiving. We see this ethic play out in ceremonies, acts of gift giving, and tobacco offering. The act of offering tobacco or gifts is done in any context in which a request is made or in which there is an anticipation of receiving. The aim is to maintain balance in the physical world and, more importantly, in the metaphysical and spiritual realms. The purpose of striving for balance is to maintain spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical wellness and harmony.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Our Collective Social Work Journey Forward</p>

	<p>Indigenous social work offers a decolonial pedagogy that contributes to the theoretical and practice knowledge of social work. It is meant for everyone. However, our social locations as Indigenous or non-Indigenous educators and practitioners will determine how we take up the insights and integrate them into our practices. Regardless of who we are, a decolonial pedagogy is a moral call and a contemporary cultural imperative. It asks us to be critical of inequity and injustice, to learn from tribal wisdom, and to take action to relieve suffering. A decolonial pedagogy will ensure that we not only talk the talk of social justice, but that we lace up our metaphorical moccasins and walk the talk as well.</p>

	<p class="background--span-color">&ldquo;&lsquo;All My Relations&rsquo; is first a reminder of who we are and of our relationship with both our family and our relatives. It also reminds us of the extended relationship we share with all human beings. But the relationships that Native people see go further, the web of kinship extending to the animals, to the birds, to the fish, to the plants, to all the animate and inanimate forms that can be seen or imagined. More than that, &lsquo;All My Relations&rsquo; is an encouragement for us to accept the responsibilities we have within this universal family by living our lives in a harmonious and moral manner&rdquo; (King, 1990: 1).</p>
