	<p>Bill Lee (1999) breaks down community work into a series of discrete phases. While these phases do not always occur in a linear fashion, they provide an idea of the process that constitutes community work. The following phases are similar to those outlined by Lee in his book, Pragmatics of Community&#160;Organizing (2011).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Pre-Entry</p>

	<p>The job of a community worker begins even before entering a community, in a process identified as pre-entry. Often before having contact with a community, a social worker is hired by a funder to complete a project. While it is preferable to begin work at the community’s direct request, it is rare that communities have sufficient resources to do this. As a result, there are tasks that the social worker can do to help prepare to collaborate effectively with community members.</p>

	<p>A social worker who is hired by a funding organization to work in a local community needs to spend time learning the general history of the community and its relationship with the funder before entering the community. He or she also needs to have a sense of the politics of the community, how the community’s problems are perceived by a diverse group of its members, and whether this differs from the funder’s understanding of the problems.The social worker also needs to understand the length of time available to do the work and what outcomes are expected (and whether the community has any input into these outcomes). This type of preparation work is vital to ensuring that an organizer is able to create a helpful beginning for the community process.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Contact and Engagement</p>

	<p>The next stage of community work is contact and engagement. It is in this phase that the community organizer starts to meet community members, listens to how they feel about their community, and begins to engage them in a process of change.</p>

	<p>Engagement is often a long and challenging process in which the organizer works to build trusting relationships with as representative a sample of the community as possible. In this phase, the worker also tries to support people in developing a sense of hope that things can change.</p>

	<p>The most challenging part of this and of later stages in community practice is that rather than doing all the work necessary to organize and create change, a social worker is always trying to support the community to do the work themselves. This often requires that the worker take a slow and often winding approach to reaching goals.</p>

	<p>The key issues in contact and engagement are significantly shaped by whether the community worker is perceived as an insider or an outsider to the community and by the amount of trust that develops between the organizer and community members. Being a community outsider presents a different set of challenges in this phase than those presented when one is a community insider. In either situation, the building of trust, broad participation, and hope that change is possible are key.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Community Analysis</p>

	<p>Since the days of the settlement movement, it has been clear that in order to create lasting social change, a community must understand itself and develop a process to gain information about what is happening to its members. The most common approach used to achieve this is participatory action research (PAR), where community members are involved in deciding the research questions, determining the research process, and analyzing the research data.</p>

	<p>Through this process two important things happen: first, community members develop skills, and second, the community gets the evidence they need to encourage power holders to listen to their demands and create change. It is far harder to ignore a community group armed with data to support their position than it is a group that is simply presenting opinions or their unique perspective.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Organizational Development</p>

	<p>The next important phase of community work is to help the community get organized and develop roles and responsibilities that people can take on to facilitate change. For example, a community association may elect board members through biannual elections in which anyone who lives within certain community boundaries can vote. Sometimes communities hire a part-time staff person to help develop community programs. Other communities rely on a large number of volunteers who make decisions as a collective. In either situation, the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes need to be clear and agreed upon.</p>

	<p>It is important in this phase (and in all phases of community practice) that social workers work with people, not for them. If we support community members in doing the work to create change, they learn skills and become more confident, and this can often help build solidarity. If a community worker does everything, then all the community learns is to be dependent on that worker. Working with people, not for them, can be difficult at times. It requires patience, and sometimes we have to let people make their own mistakes, but it is only by doing so that communities can do the learning that helps them become more confident in their decisions and processes.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Action Planning and Mobilization</p>

	<p>After a group has become organized, it is time to begin to plan actions and mobilize. The most important predictor of success at the action planning and mobilization stage is the amount of community support for any action.</p>

	<p>Any plan for moving forward relies upon people building consensus around a clear plan in which everyone knows what goals are being pursued, how long it will take to achieve these goals, and how the community is going to attain these goals. If a community is deeply divided, it is difficult to launch a successful action. There are usually three approaches to action planning. The first involves co-operating with power holders. If that approach is unsuccessful, groups can launch various types of issue-raising campaigns. If such campaigns don’t effect change, the third approach is confrontation.</p>

	<p>Key to any successful action is media coverage. Again, this requires substantial work prior to an action. Relationships need to be built with the media, and care has to be put into ensuring that the action is, in itself, media-worthy. Are there visuals for television cameras and social media? Does the group have a clear message that is easily grasped by an audience who is unfamiliar with the issue? Are the community members prepared to speak to the media? Does everyone know how to stick to the message? Do you have information for reporters so that they have the facts and the background?</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Conflict Resolution</p>

	<p>Another key component of community work is trying to mediate conflicts either within the community or with parties outside the community. In this process, a community worker needs to be aware of what is at stake in a conflict in terms of process, emotions, and content. To resolve conflict, an impartial person may need to be brought in to help each side clarify its position and to search for possible compromises. There are many different resources, workshops, and certificate programs to help social workers develop their conflict resolution skills.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Evaluation</p>

	<p>One of the final stages of community practice involves evaluation, which allows a community to reflect upon whether they were able to achieve the goals that they set for themselves. A final evaluation is most effective when evaluation has been an ongoing component of the community work. Sometimes it is driven by a funder who wants a report on outcomes, but evaluations can also provide a useful opportunity for communities to reflect upon what they have achieved and to enhance their enthusiasm and confidence for future projects.</p>

	<p>Social work with communities often addresses the same problems that individual- or family-focused counsellors deal with, but it takes a slightly different approach, looking at problems as something that a group of people experience. Community social workers go to great effort to identify people’s common experiences and to build upon them to create effective community groups capable of creating change for themselves. As they do so, community groups often gain valuable skills and are more able to effect change. And increasingly, they develop a sense that they can influence their environment and improve their lives. With this lived experience, they are armed with the skills and confidence to challenge those who exploit them, and to imagine and create a better future for themselves.</p>
