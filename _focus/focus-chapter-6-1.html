<p class="text--bold text--bold--red">Medically necessary health care on the basis of need, rather than the ability to pay</p>

<p>Today, Canada&rsquo;s health-care system&mdash;commonly referred to as medicare&mdash;is funded by government insurance, and is publicly delivered by hospitals and other health-care settings and privately delivered mainly by physicians (who are self-employed or employed by physician-owned corporations). Each province must meet the following five principles to receive funding from the federal government:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<!-- <p class="text--bold text--bold--red"></p> -->
	
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Public administration.</span> According to section 8 of the Canada Health Act, the health care insurance plan in each province must be administered and operated on a non-profit basis by a public authority responsible to the provincial government, and be subject to an audit of its accounts and financial transactions.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Comprehensiveness.</span> According to section 9, the plan must cover all insured health services (&ldquo;medically necessary services&rdquo;) provided by hospitals, medical practitioners, or dentists, and, where permitted, cover services rendered by other health care practitioners.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Universality.</span> Section 10 requires that 100 percent of the insured persons of a province be entitled to the insured health services provided for by the plan on uniform terms and conditions.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Portability.</span> In accordance with section 11, residents moving to another province must continue to be covered for insured health services by the home province during any minimum waiting period imposed by the new province, not to exceed three months.</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Accessibility.</span> By virtue of section 12, the health care insurance plan of a province must provide for: (a) insured health services on uniform terms and conditions and reasonable access by insured persons to insured health services unprecluded or unimpeded, either directly or indirectly, by charges or other means; (b) reasonable compensation to physicians and dentists for all insured health services rendered; payments to hospitals in respect of the cost of insured health services.</li>
</ul>
