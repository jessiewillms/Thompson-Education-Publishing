<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Advocating on behalf of clients and for a more effective health-care system</p>

<p>Medical social work practice is wide-ranging. It includes direct casework, group work, discharge planning, family consultation, patient advocacy, counselling for terminally ill patients, training of other professionals, and policy and administration. Almost every hospital in Canada has social workers employed in its departments, including emergency services, oncology, pediatrics, surgery, intensive care, rehabilitation, gerontology, and orthopedics.</p>

<p>Social workers in the health-care field not only work with the immediate impact of disease, injury, disability, and trauma but also with the integration of the client with the support system. This work is complex and multifaceted&mdash;incorporating education, team building, and relationship enhancement</p>

<p>Social work health practitioners generally are required to hold a graduate degree in the field, such as a Master&rsquo;s degree in social work.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Achieving Better Outcomes for Clients</p>

<p>The social worker&rsquo;s main goal is to assist the client so they can get the help and care they need prior to their recovery, adaptation, and return home. They help the client through the support system, provide education related to clients&rsquo; health concerns, and facilitate communication with other health professionals, particularly as they deal with issues of grief, depression, sadness, and anxiety.</p>

<p>Social workers typically will scan the client&rsquo;s environment both inside and outside the hospital facility, on the lookout for helpful people, organizations and programs, and helping the client and system meet current and predicted future needs. The worker may negotiate with specific health-care providers on behalf of their client to ensure the best service for their client.</p>

<p>The social worker will also work more generally with the hospital to build client-supportive programs and policies, taking part in ethics initiatives, group development, proposal writing for new program funding, and other such tasks.</p>

<p>In the hospital context, social workers work with other professional groups with skills and values that may differ from their own (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc). There are times when social workers mediate conflict, intervene in crises, or counsel and educate clients, family, and team members.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Assessing Client Needs</p>

<p>This is one of the most rewarding aspects of social work in the health-care field. A well put-together assessment and plan for moving forward can help a social worker assess all elements of concern to the client, select the best intervention point, and plan an effective strategy to enhance the client&rsquo;s health and well-being.</p>

<p>The psychosocial and environmental factors that social workers take into account when performing a needs assessments of a client are listed below:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet">What is troubling the client?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What social, health, and education services are available to this client and their family?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">Are there other systems that exist nearby but which are not available to the client?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s employment, level of education, and income?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What are the client&rsquo;s financial resources?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">Is the client&rsquo;s housing adequate and affordable? What is their neighbourhood like?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">How much stress is the client coping with and are they coping well?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What are the client&rsquo;s strengths?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">Does the client have a secure source of food?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">Is the client connected with a social network including family, friends, and others?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What was the client&rsquo;s childhood like?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s age?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s ethnic backgroundl?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s gender/sexual identity?</li>

		<li class="li--bullet">How is the client&rsquo;s overall health? Are they living with a disability?</li>

	</ul>	

<p>The social worker&rsquo;s psychosocial assessment will include these considerations, in addition to other key components such as the client&rsquo;s unique emotional, social, physical, and cognitive context. When a social worker carefully documents and analyzes these aspects of a person&rsquo;s life and their health status, the relationship and interaction between the elements can be seen more clearly.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Interdisciplinary Team Work</p>

<p>In a hospital setting, the social worker is often a member of an interdisciplinary team that includes members of other health professions, such as general medicine, nursing, nutrition, phsyiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychiatry.</p>

<p>The role of social workers is becoming more central in this holistic approach to health and healing, which addresses not only the physical aspects of health, which have commonly been addressed by physicians and nurses, but also the social, cultural, mental, and spiritual aspects. Social workers in such teams possess a distinct skill and value set. Their primary role is to prepare and represent the client at team meetings with other team members. They often throw new light on a situation to help the health-care facility provide even better care for their clients. Their goals might include helping a client do the following:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet">Cope with a new diagnosis, such as diabetes or cancer</li>
	<li class="li--bullet">Face and cope with a diagnosis of a terminal illness</li>
	<li class="li--bullet">Enter a parenting role successfully</li>
	<li class="li--bullet">Interface with providers of long-term care</li>
	<li class="li--bullet">Adjust to being discharged from hospital and benefit from appropriate post-discharge supports for recovery</li>
</ul>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work in Other Health-Care Settings</p>

<p>In addition to hospital work, social workers are involved in other health-care settings, such as hospices, local medical clinics, community health centres, and specialized care agencies (such as HIV/AIDS clinics, substance use disorder treatment centres, family planning, prenatal care, long-term care, home care, nursing homes, and services for people with disabilities).</p>

<p>Keenly aware of the social determinants of health, social workers are also active as health promoters, community developers, and policy advocates in the field of health care. For example, a social worker may work with a community health centre to promote a particular aspect of healthy living in the community. Through this work, social workers are at the forefront in addressing a preventative approach to primary health care, health promotion, and client self-care.</p>

<p>Social workers are also among the staunchest supporters and advocates of universal health care. Efficiencies and improvements are definitely needed to secure medicare and to make it work better for Canadians, but such changes must be made in the context of continuing efforts to ensure full access to quality health care for all citizens of Canada.</p>
