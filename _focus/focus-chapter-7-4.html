<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The stigmatization of mental illness may prevent individuals <br />who are contemplating suicide from seeking the support they need</p>

<p>For some time now, suicide has been a prevalent mental health issue affecting many people around the world. Suicide is non-discriminatory; it affects people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and financial statuses. In Canada, 13.4 percent of people over the age of 15 have seriously considered suicide at one point in their lives (Mental Health First Aid Canada, 2011). Moreover, 3,500 to 4,000 Canadians of various ages die by suicide each year. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death of Canadians aged 15 to 24. Furthermore, Canada has the third-highest youth suicide rate in the industrialized world. Clearly, suicide is becoming an increasingly predominant mental health problem in Canadian society.</p>

<p>Individuals often turn to suicide when they experience deep feelings of hopelessness and helplessness over a prolonged period of time. In other cases, suicide can be an impulsive act. Suicide has a ripple effect; most often, after an individual commits suicide, their families, friends, and other social circles are heavily impacted and frequently devastated. The effect of stigma surrounding suicide can be especially damaging; it is a major barrier preventing people from engaging in conversations about suicide (Ibid, 201I).</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Suicide Prevention: Warning Signs</p>

<p>Suicide does not necessary follow an escalating continuum. However, there are warning signs that an individual may be contemplating suicide. These warning signs include the following behaviours (Mental Health First Aid Canada, 2011):</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item">expressing suicidal ideations (thoughts)</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">expressing the intention to die by suicide, followed by the description of a plan to execute suicide</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">expressing negative thoughts about oneself</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">constant expressions of hopelessness, desperation, or&#160;helplessness</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">relaying final wishes to family members or friends</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">giving away important possessions, creating and/or changing a will, or arranging financial affairs</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">loss of interest in social circles, hobbies, or activities that were previously enjoyable</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">loss of appetite</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ParaOverride-7">loss of energy</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ParaOverride-7">increased or decreased sleep</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item-Last ParaOverride-7">unexpected changes in appearance or behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. Each individual can exhibit different signs of impending suicide. It is vitally important for family members, support workers, and mental health professionals to familiarize themselves with the warning signs and risk factors related to suicide.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Risk Factors and Risk Reduction</p>

<p>Risk factors that increase the possibility of suicide may include the following (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 2009):</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Suicidal behaviour.</span> A history of suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, or self-injurious behaviour</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Current/previous mental health issues.</span> Recent onset of illness may increase risk; illnesses such as mood disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol/substance use disorders, attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and conduct disorders may also increase risk</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Family history.</span> History of suicide within the family</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Key symptoms. </span>Experiencing anxiety/panic, insomnia, or&#160;hallucinations</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Precipitating factors. </span>Events that trigger feelings of humiliation, shame, or despair (e.g., financial burden, loss of a relationship); these feelings can be real or anticipated.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Related stressors. </span>Other medical issues can perpetuate more stress. Intoxication can also be a factor.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Interpersonal factors.</span> Family turmoil or chaos, history of physical or sexual abuse, or social isolation</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item-Last"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Access to weapons and firearms.</span> Weapons increase the risk of self-inflicted harm, especially during a mental health crisis.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Protective Factors</p>

<p>Certain protective factors may reduce the risk of suicide. As mentioned previously, protective factors aid an individual’s capacity to recover stability in the course of a stressful situation. Assessing an individual’s protective factors can be an integral part of suicide risk reduction.</p>

<p>According to organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, protective factors can be internal or external. Internal factors may include a person’s resilience and ability to cope with stress, their religious beliefs, or their levels of tolerance for emotional distress. External factors may include a feeling of responsibility toward others (e.g., children, partner, parents, siblings, friends, co-workers, pets); positive therapeutic relationships with mental health professionals, including social workers; and various social supports, such as an affiliation with a place of worship or a self-help group.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Safety Plans</p>

<p>Safety plans can be a key factor in suicide risk reduction. Such plans are completed by the individual, and they can be extremely helpful when that person is experiencing a crisis. Such plans are devised when the person is in comparatively good spirits and is able to reflect on how they behave when they are experiencing suicidal ideations.</p>

<p>An effective safety plan will result if the person is able to identify strategies that would reduce their risk of committing suicide during a crisis. A safety plan might include names and phone numbers of people and services to contact when a person is in distress. The people and services listed in the safety plan might include family members, close friends, crisis support agencies, emergency helplines, and contact information for support personnel, such as a psychiatrist and/or a social worker.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Organizations Seeking to Prevent Suicide</p>

<p>The Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) is a Canada-wide, non-profit organization that is dedicated to suicide prevention. This organization aims to reduce the rates of suicide in Canada and to decrease the negative connotations associated with suicide and/or suicidal behaviour. CASP also provides certification courses for crisis workers and facilitates a yearly conference that brings together researchers and other health professionals to discuss the most effective methods of suicide prevention. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.suicideprevention.ca" class="a--link-url">www.suicideprevention.ca</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is dedicated to the prevention of suicidal behaviour, the alleviation of the effects of suicide, and the promotion of a forum for academics, mental health professionals, crisis workers, volunteers, and suicide survivors. The IASP includes professionals and volunteers from more than 50 countries, and officially partners with the World Health Organization (WHO). (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.iasp.info" class="a--link-url">www.iasp.info</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) is a branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Calgary, Alberta. The CSP is an educational centre that hosts the largest English-language library dedicated to the collection and distribution of suicide prevention, intervention, and post-intervention resources. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.suicideinfo.ca" class="a--link-url">www.suicideinfo.ca</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The Jack Project was founded in 2010 by Eric Windeler and his wife, Sandra Hanington, after their son Jack died by suicide in his first year at Queen’s University. Now known as jack.org, the project encourages youth to engage, raise awareness, and reduce the stigma around the topic of mental health issues. It is the only national network of young leaders focused on peer-to-peer engagement in mental health issues. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.jack.org" class="a--link-url">www.jack.org</a></span>.)</p>

<p>For a generation of young people raised on the Internet, social media, and text messaging, the traditional approach to mental health awareness and stigma reduction just isn’t working. One of the most powerful ways to inspire students is for young people to share their experiences and spread the message that we all have mental health issues and that it is all right to reach out for help.</p>
