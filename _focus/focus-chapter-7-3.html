<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">CAMH’s Toronto Drug Treatment Court</p>

<p>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Toronto Drug Treatment Court (TDTC) program provides alternative intervention for some lawbreakers.</p>

<p>In most cases, clients in custody apply through their lawyers to the TDTC—a joint collaboration between CAMH and the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General. The program is not available to violent offenders, so most applicants have been charged with crimes such as trafficking or simple possession, prostitution, or petty property crimes.</p>

<p>Specifically, the TDTC looks for people whose criminal behaviour is directly linked to their need to support their addiction to cocaine, crack, or opiates. TDTC focuses on harm reduction by providing treatment for the underlying cause of illness, something that would be ignored within the prison system.</p>

<p>The first step is a 30-day assessment. Throughout the client’s stay with the program, he or she attends a TDTC session twice a week, while simultaneously receiving treatment three days a week at CAMH. This program, like many others, recognizes that relapse is a part of recovery, especially in the early stages, and it supports clients during that period of time.</p>

<p>Once the client is stable and a reduction in substance use is evident, the intensive stage of changing entrenched patterns of behaviour and thinking and living a healthier life begins. Clients are directed either to the Structured Relapse Prevention Program or to the Women’s or Youth Program. Those who are really struggling are referred to a residential treatment facility.</p>

<p>In phase two, clients meet with CAMH caseworkers once a week; at this point clients are expected to be abstinent from their drug of choice (crack, cocaine, or opiates) and to be working on reducing use of secondary substances, such as marijuana or alcohol. Clients often discuss the root causes of their pain, such as childhood abuse, institutionalization, or child welfare experiences. They also attend a drug treatment course once a month.</p>

<p>Caseworkers prepare clients for re-entry into school, work, and long-term housing. Closer to graduation, clients attend a support group one evening a week. To graduate from the program, clients must be drug-free for three months, in school, working, or volunteering, and in stable&#160;housing.</p>

<p>The goal is to reduce the rate of recidivism among this population and to avoid the “revolving door” of crime and addiction that tends to exist when incarceration is used to deal with substance use disorders. CAMH’s recovery model allows for more success because it keeps clients in the TDTC.</p>

<p>As one TDTC worker put it, “We’re helping our clients to recover in their communities by facing real issues and pressures and walking with them as they struggle.”</p>
