<p>Child-welfare service procedures are outlined in detail in the various provincial standards manuals. Specific criteria for determining whether a child needs protection are found in provincial child-welfare acts. What follows are the general steps for providing child-welfare services in Canada.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Initial Response to Reports of Abuse and Neglect</p>

<p>The person receiving a report of child abuse and neglect must exercise careful judgement. Workers should collect accurate information from various sources, such as the child, other family members, and neighbours, and from persons with well-meaning intentions as well as from persons intending to make malicious accusations. Even though decision making may be difficult and emotional, workers must make decisions in the best interests of the child. The response steps are as follows:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">receiving the report</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">obtaining complete information from the informant</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">assessing the motivation and credibility of the informant</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">checking records</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">determining if an investigation is necessary</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">developing an initial investigation plan</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">documenting the reported abuse or neglect</li>
</ul>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Investigation</p>

<p>The social worker should obtain detailed and complete information using interviews, observations, and assessment and service reports from professionals, checking all available records. All decisions must be based on detailed, accurate, and documented evidence. Crucial decisions must be made at this juncture in response to the following questions:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Has the child been abused?</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">What are the immediate safety needs of the child?</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Is there a risk of future harm?</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">What is the capacity of the family to protect the child?</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">What services are required by the child and family?</li>
</ul>

<p>All provincial child-welfare acts empower child-protection workers to enter premises to remove children whom they deem to be in need of protection. Workers will frequently interview children at school, as this is considered a safe and familiar environment. Interviewing children requires considerable skill and interpersonal sensitivity.</p>

<p>While each province and, indeed, each local agency has its own policies and procedures, general investigative guidelines are common. A typical investigation would include</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">conducting a telephone interview with the person who reported the alleged abuse and with any other individuals who have pertinent information;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">searching existing agency records for any present or past contact with the family, the alleged abuser, or the child;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">contacting the Child Abuse Register to ascertain if the alleged abuser is registered, and if so, why; contacting any child-welfare authorities that previously registered the alleged abuser;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">seeing the child who is alleged to have been abused and conducting an interview using methods appropriate to the child’s developmental stage and ability to communicate;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">ensuring that the alleged abuser is interviewed by the police or an agency worker pursuant to the protocol established between the agency and the police;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">interviewing the parent or person having charge of the child, if he or she is not the alleged abuser;</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">interviewing other potential victims (e.g., siblings, other children in the home, classmates);</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">gathering evidence from other professionals involved in the investigation (e.g., medical, law enforcement, educational); and</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item -Last">gathering information from other witnesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assessing the urgency of a response is critical. The child who is the subject of a report of abuse must be seen as soon as possible, generally not later than 12 hours after the report is made. To assess urgency, the social worker should consider the child’s age, the nature of the alleged abuse, the known injury to the child, the potential for the child to suffer physical harm, the availability of possible evidence (e.g., visible marks), and the immediate need for counselling or support. The worker should ensure that a medical examination is performed by a qualified medical practitioner when there is a need to document the child’s condition. A medical examination may also be necessary to ascertain whether the child has been harmed. This can be arranged by obtaining the cooperation of a parent. If cooperation cannot be obtained, it may be necessary to apprehend the child and conduct the examination without parental consent.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Substantiation</p>

<p>Agencies generally have established policies and procedures outlining how a protection substantiation decision occurs. This decision must be made at a formal meeting in consultation with the social worker’s supervisor or higher authorities. The worker should record the process of substantiation and the standards of proof for making the decision in the case file.</p>

<p>There are generally four possible investigative outcomes:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">The complaint is not substantiated.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">A protection concern is substantiated, but the child remains in the home.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item ">A protection concern is substantiated, and the child remains in the home but may be in need of protection. With this option, a plan must be developed to ensure the child’s safety, including a schedule of visits and restricted access by some family members. This approach is consistent with the philosophy of taking the “least restrictive” course of action to protect the child.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item -Last">A protection concern is substantiated, and the child is removed from the home.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Assessment Report and Service Plan</p>

<p>If abuse is verified, the law requires a complete assessment and a plan of service for the child and family. The assessment report should address the following: the nature of the abuse, precipitating factors, the nature of the dispute, family dysfunction, family background, parental capacity, family relationships, family strengths, service needs, child development, and the risk of further abuse.</p>

<p>The service plan should include the specific risk factors, service needs, strategies and service providers, ongoing care responsibility and coordination, expectations, review dates, and client involvement in the service plan.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Case Management</p>

<p>Case management is the coordination of services for clients by allocating a professional to be responsible for the assessment of need and implementation of service plans. It involves coordinating the various system components in order to achieve a successful outcome.</p>

<p>Case management activities include (1) assessment, (2) planning, (3) linking clients and services, (4) monitoring the quality of the services provided, and (5) advocacy. The primary goal is service provision for the client, not management of the system or its resources.</p>

<p>Careful record keeping is mandatory in child welfare agencies. A case worker must be able to substantiate the decisions made. Supervision, consultation, review, and decision making occur frequently during the management of all child abuse cases. All agencies have strict documentation requirements.</p>

<p>Agencies must also evaluate the effectiveness of their case management approach and make adjustments as needed. What outcomes are expected for effective service delivery to children and families?</p>
