	<p class="text--bold text--bold--red">Four powerful key concepts underlie professional social work</p>

	<p>“Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment and domestic violence. Human rights and social justice are the philosophical underpinnings of social work practice. The uniqueness of social work practice is in the blend of some particular values, knowledge and skills, including the use of relationship as the basis of all interventions and respect for the client’s choice and involvement.”</p>

	<p>This definition of social work, provided by the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW), emphasizes four key&#160;concepts:</p>


	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet">1)&#9;social change/social justice</li>
		<li class="li--bullet">2)&#9; problem solving</li>
		<li class="li--bullet">3)&#9;person in environment</li>
		<li class="li--bullet">4)&#9;empowerment</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ParaOverride-5">Social Change/Social Justice Mandate</p>

	<p>A social change/social justice mandate means working in solidarity with those who are disadvantaged or excluded from society so as to eliminate the barriers, inequities, and injustices that exist.</p>

	<p>This means that social workers should be at the forefront of policies and legislation that redistribute wealth in favour of those who are less well-off—that is, promoting equal opportunity for women, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered persons, people with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, and racialized Canadians, and defending past gains in these areas.</p>

	<p>Commitment to social change and social justice is fundamental to social work practice. Reducing inequality of opportunity and seeking ways to redress social imbalances will reduce the need for welfare services.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Problem Solving</p>

	<p>Social workers respond to crises and emergencies as well as everyday personal and social problems. They use a problem-solving process and formulate possible plans of action. A&#160;problem is not usually clearly defined when someone comes to a social service agency. It is therefore crucial for the social worker to explore the person’s concerns, to identify the need(s) involved, to identify barriers to meeting need(s), and to carefully determine the goals and possible plans of action.</p>

	<p>A key characteristic of the problem-solving process is the inclusion of the client at each stage. The process should also teach clients problem-solving skills so that they can better deal with future problems on their own.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Person in Environment</p>

	<p>A key aspect of effective social work practice is to go beyond the “internal” (psychological) factors and examine the relationship between individuals and their environments. This person-in-environment approach largely distinguishes social work practice from other helping professions. These “environments” extend beyond the immediate family to include interactions with friends, neighbourhoods, schools, religious groups, laws and legislation, other agencies or organizations, places of employment, and the economic system. Based on this understanding, intervention may focus on the individual, interactions between people and any system or structure, or on the system or structure itself.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Empowerment</p>

	<p>In order for the interventions of social workers to be successful, clients must believe that the efforts of the practitioner, as well as their own efforts, will make a difference. This leads to the concept of empowerment. Being empowered means feeling that you have power and control over the course of your life.</p>

	<p>Empowerment is the process of increasing personal, interpersonal, or political power so that one can improve one’s particular situation. Power can be a personal state of mind, in the sense that one feels one can make a difference and have control and influence over one’s own life. It can also be empowerment within an organization in the sense that one has tangible influence and legal rights.</p>

	<p>Empowerment involves both a personal perception of being in control and tangible elements of power within the various social structures of society. Social workers seek to empower their clients as a way of helping them focus on access to resources and the structures of power, among other things.</p>

	<p>Empowerment-based social work, therefore, has three main&#160;aspects:</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet">making power explicit in the client-worker relationship (to help equalize the relationship between client and worker)</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">giving clients experiences in which they themselves are in control (to allow them to see the potential for controlling their lives)</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">supporting the client’s efforts to understand the power relationships in their own lives, as well as their efforts to gain greater control over their lives as a way of promoting&#160;change</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Putting an empowerment perspective into practice involves techniques that make power relations between the workers and their clients explicit, thereby equalizing the client–worker relationship. It may entail giving clients&#173;—whether they be individuals, families, groups, or entire communities—experiences that put them in a position to exercise power. Voluntary work experiences that allow clients to use their skills to help others can be empowering. Another aspect may be to support clients’ efforts to change policies or practices that impinge on their lives and the lives of others.</p>

	<p>In other instances, an empowering perspective may involve simply focusing on the strengths of the person. In all relationships, it is generally acknowledged that constructive feedback and positive reinforcement are conducive to helping people make positive changes in their lives. Clearly, it is more helpful for social workers to guide their clients’ focus toward the success they have achieved in the past rather than dwelling on points where they have been less successful.</p>

	<p>An empowerment perspective is the key to good social work practice. And like other aspects of good practice, it involves not a specific set of skills, but a general orientation on the part of the worker. This orientation is based on helping clients identify their own needs and then assisting them to deal with the exigencies of their own particular situation.</p>

	<p>Of all the fundamental techniques available to the social work practitioner, the ability to empower the client is perhaps the most useful. The key is to help clients gain some sense of control over the difficult situation at hand and a sense that their actions will lead to positive results. Having the ability to foster a sense of client empowerment in sometimes difficult situations is an important part of the social worker’s skill set.</p>
