<p>Social workers are influenced by different theoretical perspectives, ranging from conventional to progressive. This chart links different perspectives to a sampling of social work practice skills. For further discussion of progressive practice approaches, see Case Critical: Social Services and Social Justice in Canada, 7th edition (forthcoming) by Banakonda Kennedy-Kish Bell, Ben Carniol, Donna Baines, and Raven Sinclair, Toronto: Between the Lines.
