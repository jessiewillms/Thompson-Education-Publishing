	<p>The recovery model is a concept that has been integrated into mental health services and treatments relatively recently. In the past, individuals experiencing mental health issues and their families were often told to lower their expectations in light of the fact that the individual’s symptoms would probably worsen over time (Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario, 2015). Today, however, the idea of recovery is an important foundation for how social workers and other health professionals engage with individuals living with mental health issues and with their families.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Essential Components of the Recovery Model</p>

	<p>Recovery encompasses a holistic approach toward treatment. A holistic approach “embraces the interconnectedness of our body, mind, and spirit, and encourages us to cultivate physical, mental, and spiritual health” (Hong Fook Mental Health Association, 2008). This approach focuses on the person as a whole rather than on symptoms alone, and it avoids making assumptions based on an individual’s diagnosis (Mental Health First Aid, 2010).</p>

	<p>Hope is one of the main components of the recovery model. It is vitally important for workers in the field of mental health to relay a message of hope. Regardless of the symptoms that a person might experience, individuals living with a mental illness can avail themselves of every opportunity to lead fulfilling and satisfying lives. Championing hope involves adopting an open-minded perspective, cultivating a sense of life’s possibilities, and learning to use the language of recovery—notions that stray markedly from past attitudes toward mental illness. Hope bolsters the idea that recovery is possible for anyone struggling with a mental illness.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">“Recovery” in the Context of Mental Illness</p>

	<p>The term “recovery” in relation to mental illness has a different connotation than when it is applied to physical illness or injury (Trainor et al., 2004). Moreover, in a mental health context, recovery does not necessarily mean absence of symptoms. The recovery model affirms the potential to lead a meaningful life despite co-existing symptoms.</p>

	<p>There is no single definition for recovery, which is often referred to as a journey or a process (Mental Health Foundation, 2015). This journey involves devising ways to lead a satisfying, hopeful, and productive life despite limitations that may be associated with a mental illness. Furthermore, recovery involves redefining one’s purpose in life and constructing<br />new meanings that transcend the effects of living with a mental illness.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">What Factors Influence Recovery?</p>

	<p>Recovery is a highly personal and unique process (Trainor et al., 2004). In a mental health context, recovery is seen as person-driven; each individual defines what recovery means to him or her.</p>

	<p>For some people, recovery might mean being symptom-free, while for others it could mean staying in control of their thoughts and behaviours despite their mental illness (Mental Health Foundation, 2015).</p>

	<p>The recovery model implies that individuals, families, and service providers must often shift their view about mental health and mental illness. They learn to adjust to the notion that individuals play a key role in their own recovery.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, recovery involves building upon strengths. It is essential to mobilize and tap into individuals’ talents, resources, and potential instead of focusing on their illness, symptoms, and problems.</p>

	<p>Recovery also means that individuals take responsibility for and control their own health-related choices. There is a shift in focus from illness to wellness, a lessened emphasis on symptoms, and diminished preoccupation with diagnosis, medication, and treatment in favour of focusing on more rewarding life experiences.</p>

	<p>Factors that can influence recovery include access to education and employment opportunities, quality and availability of treatment, and supportive social networks (Mental Health First Aid, 2011). Individuals’ ability and willingness to participate in their own treatment also influences recovery.</p>

	<p>Recovery is aptly described as a deeply personal and unique process of transforming one’s attitudes, feelings, values, skills, goals, and roles (Trainor et al., 2004). Because recovery is an individualized process, social workers must adapt to the remarkable diversity of persons living with mental illness.</p>

	<p>The ultimate goal of countless mental health services and treatments is recovery. Therefore, workers who engage with individuals experiencing mental health issues are entrusted with supporting their recovery process. This process starts with the acknowledgement that recovery is possible in spite of the complex issues that arise from living with a mental illness.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Family Involvement: A Crucial Factor in Recovery</p>

	<p>Families are the single largest category of caregivers of people who are suffering from a mental illness (Trainor et al., 2004). Family members thus play a pivotal role in an individual’s recovery.</p>

	<p>When a loved one is first diagnosed, his or her needs become paramount. Family members assume various roles, often providing significant financial, emotional, and social support. Their contributions may go unrecognized, however (Ibid., 2004).</p>

	<p>Living with and/or supporting a loved one with a mental illness can impact the personal health and well-being of members of that individual’s family. Family members often experience burnout, stress, and social isolation.</p>

	<p>Self-care becomes extremely important in maintaining a family’s overall health and wellness. Family members can learn a variety of coping skills to help them stave off burnout and exhaustion. Social workers can encourage family members to reach out and seek help for themselves through individual counselling or involvement in a support group.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Wellness Recovery Action Plan</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A Powerful Tool Used in the Mental Health Journey</p>

	<p>The Wellness Recovery Action Plan, or WRAP, is a peer-led mental illness self-management program that helps indviduals manage their illness and provides them with a plan when they are not well. WRAP is a best practice that is used worldwide.</p>

	<p>The program involves an educational and planning process that is grounded in mental health recovery concepts such as hope, education, empowerment, self-advocacy, and interpersonal support and connection. Within a group setting, individuals explore self-help tools, such as peer counselling, focusing exercises, and relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. They share resources for keeping themselves well and helping themselves feel better during stressful times (Canadian Mental Health Association, 2015).</p>

	<p>Shown here is Margaret Trudeau, former wife of the late Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and mother of Canada’s twenty-third prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Margaret has chronicled her own recovery related to bipolar disorder in her book <em>Changing My Mind,</em> published by HarperCollins Canada in 2010. She now advocates for better understanding of mental health issues and is an honorary patron of the Canadian Mental Health Association.</p>
