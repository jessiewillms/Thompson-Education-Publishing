	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Functional Practice Model in Social Work</p>

	<p>The functional approach was introduced in the 1930s by Jessie Taft and Virginia Robinson and is based on the work of Otto Rank, a psychologist who once worked closely with Sigmund Freud. The introduction of the functional approach to social work practice coincided with new ways of understanding the relationship between the client and the social worker.</p>

	<p>In previous approaches to practice, the therapist was seen as the “expert” who diagnosed a person’s problem and developed a course of action in response to it. The functional approach, however, emphasized the importance of the client’s role in directing change. This new approach signalled an early shift away from the “medical model” or “diagnostic approach” and the beginning of an approach to practice whereby the client and the worker engage together in a “helping relationship” aimed at achieving certain goals.</p>

	<p>Whereas Freud believed that a person’s problems were often due to negative childhood experiences, Rank emphasized the importance of life events in the present. For Rank, all human beings are engaged in a struggle between a desire to create a unique, individual identity and a desire to stay connected to, and dependent upon, others. Individual problems, therefore, can only become resolved when a person is assertive and acts as her or his own force for change (Taft, 1948).</p>

	<p>With functional theory, the goal of practice is to enhance social functioning in individuals, families, groups, and communities by assessing the problem at hand and using the client’s personal power to effect change in a structured way.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Client-Centred Practice Model</p>

	<p>Taking the functional model one step further, the client- or person-centred approach is based on the idea that clients are the experts in understanding and resolving their own problems. The client-centred approach was introduced by psychotherapist Carl Rogers in the 1950s.</p>

	<p>Rogers was greatly influenced by the philosophy of humanism, which has as its central belief the idea that all human beings are good, worthwhile, and guided by a search for meaning and purpose in life. When personal growth is impeded—usually by difficulties in relationships with others—people experience problems. The goal of therapeutic practice is to help clients empower themselves and take responsibility for making changes in their own lives. Rogers viewed the therapeutic relationship as central in this process, and believed that the therapist should strive to be genuine, empathize with clients’ world views, and provide them with unconditional positive regard (Rogers, 1951). He believed that a non-judgemental, non-directive approach, characterized by mutual respect, would help people to tap into their own personal power to stimulate and sustain change.</p>


	<p>While a client-centred model of practice can be effective, agencies offering social work services are often pressured to produce measurable results in a short period of time. Social workers often draw on cognitive behavioural approaches as more practical, time-limited practice models with clearer guidelines. These shorter-term approaches focus on modifying behaviours by changing the way we interpret our world. The results can be quantified and measured more easily.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Rational–Emotive Practice Model</p>

	<p>The rational–emotive model, introduced by psychologist Albert Ellis in the mid-1950s, blended ideas from two key areas in psychology: cognition and behaviourism. Ellis believed that the way we think (our cognition), how we feel (our emotions), and how we act (our behaviour) interact to produce outcomes (Ellis and Dryden, 1987). Irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving contribute to self-defeatism and social defeatism. Rational–emotive psychotherapy (RET) was the earliest form of a cognitive behavioural approach to social work practice.</p>

	<p>Using this model, the therapist aims to help a client see that the negative emotions being experienced are due to a distorted perception of reality. For example, if an individual believes that she is not likeable, she might experience a level of anxiety that makes it impossible for her to meet and socialize with others. With counselling, the client can gain a more accurate perception of reality, allowing her to challenge her troubling emotions, and work to change the undesirable behaviours that her thoughts and emotions have produced. This process should take place in a supportive, nurturing relationship that is directed largely by the client.</p>

	<p>Rational–emotive therapy differs from other interventions in that it places less emphasis on exploring the hidden past and more emphasis on changing the client’s current emotional state of mind. Many social workers are drawn to this form of therapy, since it encourages clients to exercise control over their own throughts and effect change in their own lives.</p>

	<p>As with other forms of cognitive therapies, some critics argue that this approach gives undue weight to clients’ psychological and emotional responses. Interventions tend to minimize the importance of the conditions in which such personal problems arise and largely ignore the structural or systemic context within which a client’s emotional problems occur.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Task-Centred Practice Model</p>

	<p>Developed in the 1980s, the task-centred practice model is a short-term intervention with a measurable outcome and proven effectiveness. Social workers assess and clarify the target problem and desired outcome, and create a list of tasks that must be accomplished in order to resolve the problem.</p>

	<p>The task-centred practice model is based on the assumption that people experiencing particular problems typically possess the resources and motivation to resolve them (Reid and Epstein, 1977). The task-centred model is particularly helpful in dealing with persistent problems such as interpersonal or relationship conflicts, problems with role performance, difficulties in making decisions, and reactive emotional stress.</p>

	<p>Critical to the success of this practice model is the extent to which personal, family, and environmental contexts support or impede the client’s problem-solving efforts.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Strengths-Based Practice Model</p>

	<p>Currently, many social workers approach practice from an individual-level, strengths-based perspective. This approach avoids pathologizing people and helps to create a foundation for future personal growth (Saleebey, 2012).</p>

	<p>The strengths-based approach was introduced by University of Kansas professor Dennis Saleebey and his colleagues Charles Rapp and Ann Weick. Saleebey’s work with people experiencing serious mental illness helped him to recognize that each person has unique strengths and abilities and, accordingly, the capacity for individual growth and change.</p>

	<p>Practitioners working from a strengths-based approach begin by encouraging the client to recognize her or his assets. The worker and client collaborate and draw on available strengths and resources in order to work toward change. The therapeutic relationship is an optimistic and empowering one.</p>
