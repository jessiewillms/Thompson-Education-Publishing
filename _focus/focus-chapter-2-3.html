	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Ensuring the highest standards of practice within Canada and internationally</p>

	<p>The profession of social work in Canada is regulated by ten provincial associations and one territorial organization, each with its own name, policy, and regulations. Each association is mandated by provincial legislation to regulate and monitor professional social workers and social work practice in<br />their jurisdiction.</p>

	<p>Each province has established regulatory bodies (sometimes referred to as Colleges) to govern the profession in accordance with the legislation. Social workers become registered or licensed by becoming members of the regulatory body in the province or territory where they work.</p>

	<p>The associations come together under the umbrella of the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW), which provides national leadership in strengthening and advancing the social work profession. The education of social workers is monitored by the national Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW)</p>

	<p>The Canadian Association of Social Workers was founded in 1926 after close to 60 social worker representatives from Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax, and Montréal met and agreed to form a Canadian association. On September 1 of that year, the constitution for the Canadian Association of Social Workers was approved.</p>

	<p>At first, social workers joined individually; there were 197 initial members. Today, the CASW is a federated organization with member organizations across the country. The first edition of its professional journal, <span class="CharOverride-2">The Social Worker</span>, appeared in 1932. A simple code of ethics was adopted in 1938 and a significantly revised code was adopted in 1956 (revised or amended in 1963, 1983, 1994, and 2005). The 2005 Code of Ethics is included in an Appendix to this book.</p>

	<p>The CASW has jurisdiction over some issues, while the provincial and territorial associations maintain jurisdiction over others. Because social services are primarily a provincial or territorial responsibility in Canada, the provincial associations assume great importance in the development, administration, and day-to-day advocacy of social work. The CASW also assesses foreign social work credentials to evaluate equivalency with Canadian standards; Québec and British Columbia have separate provincial evaluations.</p>

	<p>Data on the membership of the CASW is an indication of the rapid growth of the profession: in 1939, CASW had 600 members; by 1966, it had 3,000; and by 1986, there were 9,000 members. Today, there are about 16,000 CASW members across the country, all with some formal credentials in social work.</p>

	<p>CASW supplies members with relevant professional documents, a national journal, activities and events, access to benefits, representation nationally and internationally, and an opportunity to participate in professional development panels and organizations.</p>

	<p>CASW also influences governments through consultations, position statements, and the presentation of briefs. The main benefit of belonging to the CASW is being part of a group of like-minded people who share the same goals and work together to improve their profession.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE)</p>

	<p>The Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (CASSW) was established in 1967, replacing the National Committee of Schools of Social Work, which, since 1948, had been the forum for professional education in social work.</p>

	<p>Since 2008, CASSW has been called the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE). CASWE is a national association of university faculties, schools, and departments offering social work education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels. There is no association representing college-level social service work education.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the CASWE is to advance the standards, effectiveness, and relevance of social work education and scholarship. CASWE is responsible for reviewing and approving social work education programs. It also publishes a quarterly journal, the Canadian Social Work Review, and undertakes research relevant to the profession.</p>

	<p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW)</p>

	<p>The International Federation of Social Workers is a successor to the International Permanent Secretariat of Social Workers, founded in Paris in 1928. In 1950, the IFSW was created, with the goal of becoming an international organization of professional social workers. The IFSW represents over half a million social workers in 55 countries. The IFSW promotes social work as a profession, links social workers around the world, and promotes social policy and planning at the national and international levels.</p>

	<p>The International Association of Schools of Social Work is an association of educators and institutions involved in social work education worldwide. The IASSW adheres to all UN Declarations and Conventions on human rights, while recognizing that respect for the inalienable rights of the individual is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace.</p>
