	<p>Groups do not proceed systematically or in a linear manner through stages. Rather, they typically move back and forth between stages. For example, while conflict is usually associated with the early stages of group formation, conflicts may arise during the later phases as well, if members challenge each other or the basic framework of the group.</p>

	<p>Different theoreticians have conceptualized group development in various ways, although there is substantial agreement. Shulman (1992), for example, has outlined group development as having three general phases: beginning, middle, and end. Others have suggested that groups go through five or six stages consisting basically of orientation, conflict, negotiation, functioning, and termination (Toseland and Rivas, 2005: 87).</p>

	<p>Bruce Tuckman’s (1965) early work on the stages of group development continues to be a useful approach. He outlined the stages in an easy-to-remember way: forming, storming, norming, and performing, and he later added adjourning to that list (Tuckman and Jensen, 1977).</p>

	<p class="text--grey">The Forming Stage</p>

	<p>The forming stage has two primary components: planning the group and getting the group started.</p>

	<p>In planning a group, it is vitally important that the purpose is clearly defined (e.g., to provide support, to educate, or to accomplish a specific task). The purpose should be broad enough to attract a sufficient number of people with somewhat varying needs, and yet specific enough to define the common nature of the group. The facilitator should also think about whom the group is intended to attract. In other words, for whom is the group designed? Knowing the group’s objective helps the social worker in the screening process to determine who is appropriate to join the group.</p>

	<p>Part of planning also includes issues such as the length of the group meetings, the frequency with which the group meets, and the duration of the group. It is also important at this stage to consider whether the group will be open to new members along the way or whether it will be a closed group.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">The Storming Stage</p>

	<p>The storming stage occurs when conflict emerges in the group. Differences in members’ understanding of the group’s purpose and the group members’ roles and expectations can lead to friction. If it is a voluntary group, members may decide not to return at this stage.</p>

	<p>This is the time when members test and challenge the authority of the facilitator. Although this can be a difficult phase in the life of a group, it is also a time when growth can occur and when relationships can be established and strengthened.</p>

	<p>By anticipating conflict, group leaders can help members to view conflict as a natural or helpful part of group development and as an opportunity to gather information and share views and opinions rather than as a personal attack.</p>

	<p>It is at this stage that the facilitator can be highly influential in establishing a tone for the group and modelling the essential ground rules. This modelling might involve encouraging members to own their statements, listen without interrupting others, ask questions or take time to reflect before reacting in a “knee-jerk” manner, and addressing and responding to each other in a respectful manner.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">The Norming Stage</p>

	<p>In the norming stage, group norms (expectations, standards, or common practices) and roles become more clearly defined, and members establish a sense of trust with each other. Group cohesion increases, and the group moves toward working on the agreed-upon objectives. One example of a useful norm to establish is that everyone has a right to be heard. It is also useful to encourage members to talk directly to each other rather than communicating through the facilitator.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">The Performing Stage</p>

	<p>In this stage, the group members work toward achieving the outlined goals. Trust and a sense of confidence with each other are evident. Members might disclose painful personal issues from their past and seek assistance and support from each other. Group cohesion is strong, and group participation is lively, with attendance at sessions generally high.</p>

	<p>During this stage, individuals begin to consider other group members as friends and feel a sense of connectedness to each other and to the group facilitator. The role of the facilitator is largely one of maintaining a safe and supportive environment for the group members. The facilitator will refocus the group should members get off track. This is the stage in which both the members and the facilitator feel rewarded for their efforts.</p>

	<p class="text--grey">The Adjourning Stage</p>

	<p>The adjourning stage occurs when the group moves toward termination. Group members may start disengaging from each other. Some members may express increased anxiety about the group ending, while others might deal with the group’s termination by participating less actively or attending group sessions more sporadically.</p>

	<p>Groups come to an end for a variety of reasons. For example, some groups have a fixed timeline, and when the eight or twelve sessions are completed, the group is finished. A group may also terminate because its goals have been met and people are ready to move on. A group may also fall apart and disintegrate because members are no longer committed to the purpose for which the group was established. Part of the work of the facilitator is to assist the members in ending the group together positively.</p>

	<p>One of the tasks of termination is evaluating the group experience. Evaluation can be done either in a formal way, in which the facilitator systematically collects information at the beginning, middle, and end of the group, or in an informal way. For example, group members might be asked in the final session to identify what was valuable about the group and what they found to be less helpful.</p>
