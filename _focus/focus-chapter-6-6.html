	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Today, 147 CLSCs continue to serve as the point of entry for the Qu&eacute;bec population to the province&rsquo;s Health and Social Service Networks</p>

	<p>With the death of Premier Maurice Duplessis in 1959 and the election of the Liberal government under Jean Lesage (shown here) in 1960, Qu&eacute;bec entered what is generally referred to as the Quiet Revolution. This period was marked by a radical transformation of Qu&eacute;bec society in which the State took over control of health and social services.</p>

	<p>Up to the time of the Quiet Revolution, at least for the French-speaking population of Qu&eacute;bec, health and social services were under the control of the Catholic Church.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Castonguay-Nepveu Report</p>

	<p>In 1966, Premier Jean Lesage mandated Claude Castonguay and G&eacute;rard Nepveu to chair a commission of inquiry into health and welfare (Commission d&rsquo;enqu&ecirc;te sur la sant&eacute; et le bien-&ecirc;tre social, CESBES).</p>

	<p> The report, known as the Castonguay-Nepveu Report, was published in 1970 and provided a blueprint for the reorganization of health and social services in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>

	<p>As a first step, the Qu&eacute;bec government, under Premier Robert Bourassa, created the Ministry of Social Affairs (Minist&egrave;re des affaires sociales) and appointed Claude Castonguay as its first minister.</p>

	<p>Then, in 1971, even before the ink on the Castonguay-Nepveu Report was dry, the Qu&eacute;bec government passed a law (la Loi sur les services de sant&eacute; et les services sociaux) commonly known as Bill 65. This law called for six structures:</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet-item">regional health and social service councils, les conseils r&eacute;gioneaux de la sant&eacute; et des services sociaux, CRSSS;</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">community health departments, les d&eacute;partements de sant&eacute; communautaires, DSC;</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">residential centres, les centres d&rsquo;accueils, CA;</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">hospital centres, les centres hospitaliers, CH;</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">social service centres, les centres de services sociaux, CSS; and</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">local community service centres, les centres locaux de services communautaires, CLSC.</li>
		</ul>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Three New Structures and Twleve New Regions</p>

	<p>As stated in the law (Bill 65), each of the structures were to be administered by a board of directors that was required to include community representation.</p>

	<p>Three of these structures&mdash;namely the residential centres, the hospital centres, and the social service centres&mdash;already existed, while the regional health and social service councils, the community health departments, and the local community service centres were totally new structures.</p>

	<p>The Qu&eacute;bec Government divided the provinces into twelve regions, each of which would be administered by a regional health and social service council (CRSSS) whose role it was to organize the health and social services programs based on the needs of the population within its region. The community health departments were integrated within the hospital centres and were responsible for epidemiological studies on health concerns and the evaluation of programs with a focus on preventative care.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Innovative Nature of the CLSCs</p>

	<p>The most innovative of the new structures was the CLSCs. Qu&eacute;bec, which has been described by Shah and Moloughney (2001), as being in the forefront in the development of community health centres in Canada, created the CLSCs to provide a multi-service &ldquo;one-stop&rdquo; agency for the provision of basic health and social services throughout the province.</p>

	<p>As explained by Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2015, p. 47), &ldquo;CLSCs were mandated to provide the delivery of preventative, restorative and ongoing health and social services at home, school, work or in a clinic to older adults with loss of autonomy, at-risk children and families, persons with physical disabilities, children with learning disabilities, persons living with mental health challenges, and persons in need of family physicians.&rdquo; However, as stated by Gaumer and Fleury (2008), the development of the CLSCs was not without controversy. Many of the CLSCs in the various communities evolved from the grass-roots initiatives of community organizers who wanted to maintain community control.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Although few in number, the community organizers were to play a particularly important role in developing and supporting community organizations, and the CLSCs emerged as bona fide laboratories for social innovation especially when they were first created&rdquo; (p. 91).</p>

	<p>During the mid-1970s, some Qu&eacute;bec politicians were nevertheless concerned about the role of the community organizers, suggesting that the CLSCs had become sites of left-wing protests and &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo;</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">New Health and Social Service Networks</p>

	<p>In response, the Government launched l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ration bilan and commissioned a panel of experts to evaluate the functioning of the CLSCs. Robert Mayer (2002) explained that the formal report of l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ration bilan, which included the majority of the panel members, recommended that the CLSCs should spend less time engaging in social activism and more on providing basic health and social services to be offered by multidisciplinary teams of professionals. At the same time, a smaller dissenting group of panelists prepared a minority report and insisted that the CLSCs should &ldquo;at all cost&rdquo; preserve its social action role (ibid., p. 296).</p>

	<p>By the early part of the 1980s, the Qu&eacute;bec Government, trying to regain control, gradually forced the CLSCs to tailor their services to the unique needs of each local community but standardize their practices and focus on priority areas such as home care for the elderly and mental health. For example, in the Qu&eacute;bec City region, the CLSCs were the only organizations to offer psycho-social counselling for people living with mental health problems (Gaumer and Fleury, 2008).</p>

	<p>More recently, in 2005, the CLSCs lost even more of their autonomy when the Qu&eacute;bec Government passed a new law, la Loi modifiant la Loi sur les services de sant&eacute; et les services sociaux, or Bill 83, that modified the 1971 law and grouped health and social services into eighteen regions to be administered by Health and Social Service Networks, Centres de sant&eacute; et de services sociaux, CSSS.</p>

	<p>In each of these regions, the CLSCs, residential long-term centres, and general and specialized hospital centres were merged and were required to co-ordinate their services with other suppliers in the regions (Gaumer and Fleury, 2008). As explained by Ives, et al. (2015), today the 147 CLSCs continue to serve as the point of entry for the Qu&eacute;bec population to the Health and Social Service Networks.</p>
