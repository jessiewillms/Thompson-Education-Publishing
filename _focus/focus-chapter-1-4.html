	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">New media can blur the boundaries between the personal and the public</p>


	<p>The last two decades have seen an immense expansion in the number of young professionals using social media to stay informed and connected. Social workers are increasingly using electronic technology in their practice. At the practitioner level, email and Internet-mediated direct practice is ubiquitous, and sources of information for evidence-based practice are easily accessed online. At the agency level, software programs are used for service planning and delivery and for case management reporting (NASW, 2005). Technology has changed the ways in which social workers respond to the demands of practice in virtually every area of the profession.</p>

	<p>Social media sites provide many benefits to the service user and the global community. Benefits include sharing information and resources with a wider audience at a low cost, community building, research promotion, and imparting ideas and expertise on issues that impact health and well-being (CASW, 2014). However, there are also risks and challenges that require social workers to assess both their personal and professional use of digital technology with a critical eye.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Technology and Learning</p>

	<p>Today, instructors’ efforts to prepare students to engage in social work practice include the appropriate use of social media within their work contexts. Young professionals learn how online encounters and communication might influence and shape future face-to-face encounters.</p>

	<p>The incorporation of the ethical use of social media is an evolving topic in social work education. One example is provided by Dr. Tarsem Singh Cooner at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, who incorporates an enquiry-based blended learning design into the university’s social work curriculum. Students explore issues such as online safety; projecting and maintaining a professional online image; maintaining personal and professional boundaries; using social networks to develop and share effective professional practice; and working for the benefit of future service users. Cooner has also developed a mobile phone/tablet app to help social workers explore how to navigate the ethical issues inherent in using social media in social work.</p>

	<p>Other examples of integrating digital literacy skills in the classroom include creating collaborative digital stories to explore social justice, oppression, and diversity (Walsh, Shier, Sitter, and Sieppert, 2010). Still other examples include developing blended advocacy strategies that combine online applications such as Facebook posts and Vine with face-to-face engagements (Sitter, 2015). (Vine is a short-form video-sharing service that allows users to share looping video clips lasting six seconds. American microblogging website Twitter acquired Vine in October 2012, just before its official launch. By the end of 2015, Vine had 200 million active users.)</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Media in University Settings</p>

	<p>The term “participatory media” refers to visual, mobile, and social media applications and platforms in which the audience plays an active role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating content. Participatory media are increasingly being used in classrooms, practice settings, and schools of social work, resulting in the increased development of social media policies in university settings. All social work students should ensure familiarity with and an understanding of their university’s technology policies.</p>

	<p>As students move toward professional practice, beginning in the classroom and continuing in their practicums, it is important for them to think critically about professional–personal boundaries, self-disclosure, dual and multiple relationships, privacy, and conflict of interest (Johns, 2012). Social work students, faculty members, and social workers are individuals with private lives. However, off-duty conduct matters and may have a bearing on social workers’ professional lives and, in some cases, on how fit they are to graduate or to practise. As social media are intricately integrated into our daily lives, social work students and professionals may possess a false sense of online security and privacy. Early in their career, professionals may not recognize the potentially unintended audience or the permanency of the information they share (Fang et al., 2014).</p>

	<p>Multiple examples of the impact of personal behaviour on career potential have been portrayed in the media (e.g., Dalhousie University dentistry students who participated in posting misogynistic Facebook entries) and at universities (e.g., students violating another student’s privacy by making a video of a presentation without consent, or students posting information about practicum placements on Facebook). Public figures and politicians have been exposed on the basis of photographs taken of them or speeches they made many years ago, for which they are held accountable in the present.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Ethical Use of Digital Technology in Social Work</p>

	<p>Online self-help support groups have been available since the early 1980s, and today online counselling services, chat counselling, video counselling, and cyber therapy using 3-D avatars are readily available. Social workers have a responsibility to use technology proficiently and to assess the advantages and disadvantages of practising technology-based social work. Ethical practice aimed at protecting vulnerable clients and upholding the values of the profession is required for electronic and online communication, just as it is required for face-to-face interactions (ACSW, 2013). Key ethical issues that arise when using any electronic technology are client privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, conflict of interest, boundaries, consultation and client referral, termination and interruption of services, documentation, and research evidence (Reamer, 2013). Increasingly, provincial Colleges of Social Workers are developing standards of practice to govern the ethical use of technology.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Personal Is Public</p>

	<p>Fang, Mishna, Zhang, Van Wert, and Bogo (2014) coined the term “the personal is public,” referring to the lack of separation between our online and offline selves. “Personal” posts may be neither private nor secure. Anyone can pull up a post, and bystanders can click the “Like” button or other emoticon or comment on the post, thus inadvertently creating an increasingly public forum for the initial post. As Fang et al. (2014) illustrate in their case examples, a student might make a derogatory comment about another student, a social work colleague, or an instructor, which the targeted person can view when “mutual friends” participate in the post string, and the situation can escalate. Just as worrisome are those observers who silently endorse the post regardless of hateful or oppressive comments. These bystanders are witnesses to bullying behaviour, similar to that of children in a schoolyard.</p>
	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Implications for Social Work Practice</p>

	<p>Opportunities abound to act as leaders in the emerging use of digital and social media literacies in practice contexts. While participatory media do not afford a magical solution in confronting problems in our work, it is a tool that can serve to amplify clients’ voices, mobilize support, and foster connections that transfer knowledge both online and offline.</p>

	<p>Digital technology requires thoughtful consideration of its strengths and limitations. We need to move beyond our fear of the unknown and look at the potential of technology to support the individuals, groups, and communities we work&#160;alongside.</p>
