<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Social work practice in community health care</p>

<p>The goals of social work in community health care include mobilizing clients&rsquo; strengths; offering a holistic perspective; identifying support networks; helping clients navigate through complex bureaucracies; providing information; and sometimes counselling. Many of the goals and interventions are similar regardless of the health-care setting. But there are some differences. How do social work skills translate when a worker interfaces with a community health-care system?</p>

<p>Social workers in community health care assist clients as they adjust to illness or disability, incorporating community strengths in the wellness plan they construct with a client. Practitioners in this area often follow up on previous discharge planning work if the client has just come home from the hospital. This responsibility for follow-up allows the community worker to monitor the client&rsquo;s emotional responses to their situation; explore various options in terms of medical treatment, employment, or housing; seek out essential resources; and offer ongoing support. The worker can help the client explore their own role in recovery and seek ways to build up their confidence and optimism.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most important client-centred roles for a community social worker is their work with family members. Family members may offer invaluable support or pose a risk to the client&rsquo;s recovery and well-being. In an ideal situation, however, the individuals who can offer the most help to recovering clients are members of the person&rsquo;s own family. In fact, three in ten people in Canada are family caregivers, providing care to a parent or grandparent, spouse, or child. In 2012, caregivers spent 4 to 14 hours per week providing this kind of care. Caregivers often report spending less time with their own children and their caregiving can have negative effects on family relationships and on the caregivers&rsquo; own health. They frequently report feeling depressed and in need of financial assistance. Some provide care on a full-time basis.</p>

<p>Social workers interface frequently with caregivers as they provide care to a family member. This social work role is very important because they see first-hand the burden felt by caregivers and are often able to provide helpful links to community supports.</p>

<p>Moreover, social workers are trained to recognize and intervene effectively when relational stressors, intergenerational conflict, and precursors to abuse arise. As skilled facilitators, counsellors, and system navigators, social workers strengthen community health-care programs. Collaborative multidisciplinary models that have been advanced in health-care circles, efforts to improve the social determinants of health, and work designed to empower marginalized groups are central goals in the delivery of community health care.</p>

<p>Kicho&rsquo;s story demonstrates how social workers can intervene with a client, the client&rsquo;s family, and community health-care resources simultaneously on the client&rsquo;s behalf. The story underscores the fact that the most powerful resource a community has to offer is often the collective lived experience and wisdom of the members of that community&mdash;especially if they are given an opportunity to support one another in a safe and caring environment.</p>
