<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Social work practice with persons who are dying</p>


<p>Social work is prominent in palliative care and hospice settings in hospitals, community residences and agencies, and private homes. <span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Hospice and palliative care</span> is focused on reducing the severity of disease symptoms, rather than providing a cure, for people at the end of life. It can also include bereavement support for family members and caregivers.</p>

<p>The essence of palliative care is holistic, collaborative, and client-focused. The comfort of the dying individual is the first priority. Social workers assist the dying individual, family, and team members as they help each other to make the process of dying meaningful. Expertise in collaboration, facilitation, communication, system navigation, and psychosocial assessment makes the social work role crucially important in palliative care.</p>

<p>Generally, hospice social work includes one or more of the following services.</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Pain management.</span> Often, life-threatening illness causes pain. Social workers consult with other health-care providers to determine what is causing the pain and the best ways to relieve it. Pain may be managed with narcotics and other drugs, but also by means of massage therapy and relaxation exercises, including mindfulness meditation.</li>

		<li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Symptom management.</span> Social workers report symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, difficulty breathing, bladder/bowel problems, and confusion to the medical team.</li>

		<li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Social, psychological, emotional, and spiritual support.</span> Social workers often focus on the well-being of the person in the final days of their lives. People in such circumstances confront a variety of psychological and spiritual issues. Different kinds of support to both the individual and the family may be helpful in these instances.</li>l
	</ul>

<p>Caregiver support. Social workers work closely with family and other caregivers, providing necessary support, not only during the patient&rsquo;s last stages of life, but also during the bereavement process.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work in Palliative Care Settings</p>

<p>Palliative care is health care for individuals who are living with a life-threatening illness, usually at an advanced stage. The goal is to provide the best quality of life for the critically or terminally ill person and ensure their comfort and dignity. Hospice palliative care focuses on holistic care by offering a wide range of health, emotional, and spiritual support services.</p>

<p>Palliative care is provided in a variety of places&mdash;at home, in long-term facilities, in hospitals, and in hospices. The Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, for example, has a palliative care unit that serves cancer patients. Other centres, such as the Maison Michel Sarrazin facility in Qu&eacute;bec (the first such facility opened in Canada in 1985), offer a network of services, providing both care at the facility and support in the home.</p>

<p>Social workers offer hands-on support and assistance in such situations. They provide instructions on how to care for the person, administer medication, and recognize signs of impending problems that might require emergency assistance. They may also help family members work through emotions regarding the illness or death of a loved one, as Sidney&rsquo;s story shows.</p>
