small_image_caption_name: Charlotte Whitton

small_image_caption_text_1: A femininst who held strong views on women’s equality, Charlotte Whitton (1896-1975) was at the same time a strong social conservative for whom the notion of state-funded health insurance was unacceptable.

small_image_caption_text_2: As mayor of Ottawa from 1951 to 1956 and again from 1960 to 1964, Whitton was the first female mayor of a major city in Canada. She became the founding director of the Canadian Council on Child Welfare from 1920 to 1941 (which became the Canadian Welfare Council, now the Canadian Council on Social Development) and helped bring about new legislation to aid children.

<p id="kc-1"><span class="text--bold text--bold-red">Universal public health care,</span> the system all Canadians know and benefit from today, came about as a result of a great deal of deliberate work on the part of citizens, advocacy groups, and policymakers. The Canadian health care system is not perfect by any means, but certainly it is one of the best&mdash;and arguably the best&mdash; in the world. Prior to the late 1940s, before the fight for universal health care began in earnest, access to health care was based solely on one&rsquo;s ability to pay. Most Canadians had no access to health care whatsoever.</p>

		<p class="text--sans-serif text--bold">Pressure to Implement Universal Health Care</p>

		<ul class="ul--timeline-sub-ul">
			<p>The British North America Act of 1867 established the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial governments in delivering health-care services. The division between the two was simple. The larger tax base of the federal government allowed it to exert a strong influence on Canadian health policy, as it continues to do today. The management of health fell to the provinces.</p>

			<p>From 1880 to the 1950s, there were a variety of pre-payment health plans in place across Canada, sponsored by local governments, industries, and volunteer agencies (Vayda and Deber, 1995), but that was all that was available to average citizens. By 1934, for example, there were twenty-seven hospital-sponsored pre-payment plans in six provinces. Medical associations and hospitals also developed health insurance plans in Ontario, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia. In 1939, the first Canadian Blue Cross plan was formed in Manitoba, with most provinces following suit in the 1940s. But these voluntary plans did not cover all medical services, and were available only to those who could pay the premiums.</p>

			<p>Provincial governments were slow to move toward universal health care and they only reacted under pressure from non-governmental groups. For example, in British Columbia, relief workers, the One Big Union, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) put intense pressure on the government of Thomas Dufferin (&ldquo;Duff&rdquo;) Pattullo to institute comprehensive health insurance in the 1930s. In 1933, the Pattullo government included health care as a key component of its election platform. The health-care legislation passed a third reading, but because of opposition from doctors, the government refused to enact it. Health insurance plans were also blocked in Alberta by the powerful Alberta Medical Association.</p>

		<p class="text--sans-serif text--bold">The Marsh Report, 1943</p>

		<ul class="ul--timeline-sub-ul">
			<p>The lines of opposition were not always clear-cut even within the field of social work itself. For example, the 1942 Heagerty Report and the 1943 Marsh Report both recommended state-funded health insurance. The Heagerty Report proposed a federally funded, two-stage health insurance scheme. The report received widespread support, including from the labour movement and the Canadian Medical Association, but foundered because of federal-provincial disagreements. The more conservative Social Service Council, on the other hand, led by Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton, opposed the idea of state-funded health insurance.</p>

			<p>The Marsh Report of 1943, which detailed the need for comprehensive and universal social programs, including health care, can be regarded as a critical event in the history of social welfare. Indeed, Canadian historian Michael Bliss described the Marsh Report as &ldquo;the most important single document in the history of the Welfare State in Canada.&rdquo; The report recommended that the country establish a &ldquo;social minimum,&rdquo; a standard aimed at protecting the disadvantaged through policies such as social insurance and children&rsquo;s allowances. By 1966, most of Marsh&rsquo;s recommendations had become law in Canada.</p>

		<p class="text--sans-serif text--bold">Canada&rsquo;s Unique Health-Care Model</p>

		<ul class="ul--timeline-sub-ul">
			<p>In 1947, the first public insurance plan for hospital services was instituted in Saskatchewan. By 1961, all provinces and territories had signed agreements with the federal government for limited, in-patient hospital care with federal cost sharing. In 1962, Saskatchewan was the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government under the leadership of Tommy Douglas on the one hand, and the medical establishments on the other. The Saskatchewan universal health care program was finally launched by Douglas&rsquo;s successor, Woodrow Lloyd, in 1962.</p>

			<p>In 1964, Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker (also from Saskatchewan) appointed Justice Emmett Hall to chair a Royal Commission on Health Care. The resulting Hall Report disclosed that 7.5 million Canadians did not have medical coverage and recommended a comprehensive health service patterned on the Saskatchewan model. Women&rsquo;s organizations and organized labour were particularly strong supporters. The Liberal minority government that followed, supported by the newly established New Democratic Party (now led by Tommy Douglas), continued to push for universal health care.</p>

			<p>The Medical Care Act was passed in 1968. By 1972, all provinces and territories had extended their plans to include physicians&rsquo; services, although physicians were permitted to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; and extra billing was permitted.</p>

			<p>Subsequently, the <span class="text--bold text--bold--red">Canada Health Act</span> (1984) changed the funding structure, prohibited opting out and extra billing, and further strengthed the universal nature of the public health-care system in Canada.</p>
