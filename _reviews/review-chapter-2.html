  - title: Exploring Social Work
    questions:
      - text: "Cindy Blackstock wrote: “To what standard of courage and compassion should we hold social workers—are we willing to support them when they identify acts that upset our sensibilities, or are we as a society willing to tolerate their silence in the face of atrocities? These are difficult questions that have remained underground in social work and need to be unearthed if we are to deconstruct our professional past in a way that makes obvious the thinking that fuels colonization.” Write a brief personal response to this stance that reflects the main ideas in Cindy Blackstock’s article, included in this chapter."
