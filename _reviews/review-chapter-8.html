  - title: Exploring Social Work
    questions:
      - text: Re-read the section entitled “Other Persistent Problems Affecting Women in Canada” in this chapter and choose one of the identified issues to explore in greater depth. Write a brief paper that explains how women tend to be at a disadvantage in terms of programs and legislation related to minimum wage, pensions, or Employment Insurance. Suggest some changes that would increase equality in the area you’ve chosen to examine, and provide research to support your ideas.
      - text: The suicide of 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons in 2013 created renewed awareness of the issues of sexual assault, cyberbullying, and victim blaming. Explore the use of social media to perpetrate abuse against women and present an argument for some form of legislation to combat this phenomenon.
      - text: Gender-based analysis Plus (GBA+) is a tool that helps to assess the differential impact of proposed and/or existing policies, programs, and legislation on both women and men. Go to the Status of Women Canada website (www.swc-cfc.gc.ca) and search for “Gender-based analysis Plus.” Write a two-page paper on how GBA+ can help inform social work practice. While the model was developed to inform policy analysis, you might find that it is just as relevant to direct practice. How could the eight steps of GBA+ be applied in direct practice?
