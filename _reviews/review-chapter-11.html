  - title: Exploring Social Work
    questions:
      - text: "What kind of social work services do you believe are necessary for older adults to continue to live on their own? What are the roles of social workers in helping seniors “age in place”?"
      - text: "A major part of social work practice with older adults is helping them deal with end-of-life difficulties, including pain and spiritual and emotional questions. Discuss this topic in small groups and do a group presentation that depicts how social workers might assist older adults in hospice care. Include reflections on the kind of training that might help social workers in this type of work."
      - text: "Write a brief response to the following comment by Dr. Chris Simpson, past president of the Canadian Medical Association: “We have emergency doctors treating patients in hallways because there are no beds. We have staff scrambling to free up beds. And we have social workers calling in favours to get a bed in a local nursing home.... We need a national seniors strategy to ensure that patients who are well enough to leave the hospital actually have some place to go. We need better home care and residential options so that we never again have to hear the term ‘bed-blocker.’”"
