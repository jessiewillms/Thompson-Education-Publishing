What can social workers do both at the practice level and the policy level to help prevent this?
      - text: Research how child-welfare legislation in your province or territory has changed over the past several years. What positive policies have been implemented? What laws might restrict a social worker’s ability to apply best practices? What areas are still in need of improvement?
      - text: Suggest some possible self-care strategies by which child welfare workers might reduce burnout nd compassion fatigue as a result of work-related pressures and sometimes overwhelming caseloads. What might indicate whether these strategies are successful in mitigating signs and symptoms of burnout and fatigue?
