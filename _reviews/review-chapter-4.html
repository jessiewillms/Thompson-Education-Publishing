  - title: Exploring Social Work
    questions:
      - text: Graphic organizers known as “genograms” can be helpful in beginning to understand family dynamics. Do some research about genograms, and then create one for your own family, showing the complex relationships between family members—today and over generations. Show how you and various members of your family interact with people and institutions in ways that might be relevant to a better understanding of your family today.
      - text: Social work with individuals and families involves the skill of active listening. You have the opportunity to practise this skill every day. Choose a period of time in your week when you are in dialogue and consciously practise active listening. Notice how your perception shifts when you consciously listen. How is it different from your usual form of listening? How would this benefit you in your role as a social worker or social service worker? Record your experience in a two-page report. Be sure to indicate how this technique might be employed in a practice setting.
      - text: Do some research or draw upon your own experience to describe Bill Lee’s phases of community work in a real-world context.
