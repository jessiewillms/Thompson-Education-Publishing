    questions:

First Nations Child Poverty in Ontario.” In a two-page summary, describe the main contributing factors to First Nations child poverty in Canada’s largest province as well as the report’s key recommendations for the eradication of child poverty in First Nations communities.

      - text: On September 13, 2007, the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration establishes a universal framework of minimum standards, but Canada was one of four nations to reject it at the time. On November 12, 2010, the government of Canada finally formally endorsed the Declaration. However, some observers felt that the government’s official statement fell short of actual endorsement. Beginning with the Assembly of First Nations website (www.afn.ca), research this issue and write a two-page paper summarizing your research&#160;findings.
