	<p>When designing social welfare programs, a key distinction is whether they are universal or&#160;selective.</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">Universal programs.</span>These programs are available to everyone in a specific category (such as people aged 65 and over, people with disabilities, or children) on the same terms and as a right of citizenship. The idea is that all persons are equally eligible to receive program benefits, regardless of income or financial situation.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">Selective programs.</span>These programs target those who are found to be in need or eligible, based on a means (or income) test or a needs test. A means test determines eligibility based on the income of the prospective recipient. The benefit is reduced according to income level, and there is always a level at which no benefit is granted. A needs test determines eligibility based on the income and the need of the prospective recipient. Eligibility criteria are used to define need, which is then compared to the prospective recipient’s life situation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In the post–World War II era, universal programs were seen as a way to build national solidarity. More recently, they have been viewed as too expensive and have all but disappeared. The foremost objection to universal programs is their cost. Giving a benefit to everyone, regardless of income, means that even the wealthy get a benefit. Universal programs are less expensive to administer, however, as they do not require the scrutiny of every person’s situation to determine eligibility.</p>

	<p>Selective programs are often viewed as more efficient and less costly, as benefits are only provided to those most in need. However, identifying eligible recipients using means or needs tests can be administratively complex and costly and take money out of the system that could be directed toward benefits. In some cases, the higher administrative costs are being partially avoided by using the tax system as a method of determining eligibility and dispensing benefits. Increasingly, social policy experts are seeing that some selective programs are necessary for tackling poverty and inequality.</p>

	<p>While some programs include aspects of universality, there are no income security programs remaining that can be exactly defined as universal. Health care and education are examples of universal service programs, but they are not income security programs. In the past, a number of universal income security programs were available to Canadians. Family Allowance, which was available from 1944 to 1993, is the most commonly cited example. All families with a child under the age of 18 were entitled to a financial benefit. Because of the progressive tax system, wealthier people paid much of the costs back through taxation, but it was nevertheless an acknowledgement of citizenship entitlement and of the importance and cost of raising children. In 1993, the Family Allowance was redesigned to become a targeted program, the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), only available to low- and middle-income families.</p>

	<p>The Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) was introduced by the Conservative government in 2006 as a taxable benefit. In 2015, the Conservative government enhanced the UCCB to include a new benefit for children aged 6 through 17 and payments for children under the age of 6 were increased. Following up on an election campaign promise, early in 2016 the new Liberal government announced the Canada Child Benefit program, which pays up to $6,400 per child under age 6 and up to $5,400 per child aged 6 through 17. However, under the new program, the child benefits begin to phase out starting at $30,000 in net family income.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Selective Entitlements</p>

	<p>All of Canada’s other income security programs offer selective entitlements. Most have complex selection criteria based on income, work history, or the willingness to find a job. Employment Insurance (EI), for example, is based on an insurance principle with eligibility tied to employment and income levels. Everyone within the broad category of “employee” pays into the program, so in this sense it is comprehensive, but a strict set of criteria determines who is eligible to receive benefits. The level of benefits depends on one’s earnings and contributions. With more demands being placed on the system, the debate over the amount and duration of EI payments is likely to heat up.</p>

	<p>Other programs are based on how much money one has and whether it meets one’s needs. To be eligible for social assistance, one must prove that one’s income and assets fall below a certain level. In provinces with workfare, such as Ontario and Alberta, applicants must also comply with an employment or training placement.</p>

	<p>Subsidized housing is another example of selective programming. Through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the federal government helps to improve access to affordable housing programs across the country. Most are administered by the provinces and territories.</p>
