	<p>In the nineteenth century, public assistance in English Canada largely followed England’s example. In the face of the massive social disruption that had been caused by rapid industrialization, early English legislation required local parishes to provide relief to poor people if they were elderly, ill, or disabled.</p>
	
	<p>The parishes were organized by the Church of England. Each had a local council that was responsible for assisting the poor, or providing “poor relief.” The Poor Law of 1601</span> and its reform in 1832 carefully distinguished between two types of relief: one for the elderly and sick, who could receive relief in almshouses or poorhouses, and one for the able-bodied poor, who were made to labour in workhouses in exchange for relief. The purpose of the latter type of aid was to make the seeking of such public assistance shameful and demeaning.</p>

			<p class="text--caption">In the nineteenth century, even children were forced to work in factories and on farms for relief from poverty. For many families, it was more important for a child to bring home a wage than to get an education. Dangerous working conditions and long hours meant that children worked as hard as adults, but no laws existed to protect them.</p>
			<p class="text--caption">Children were less expensive to employ than adults, and they were easier to discipline. In rural areas, children as young as five worked in “agricultural gangs.” In 1821, approximately 49 percent of Britain’s workforce was under the age of 20. The <span class="CharOverride-2">Factory Act</span> of 1833 made it illegal for textile factories to employ children under 9 years of age. </p>
			<p class="text--caption">Government regulations eventually limited the number of hours in a day children worked in factories, but employers were not necessarily liable for accidents until 1937.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Deserving and Undeserving Poor</p>
	
	<p>Following a request for assistance, a charity visitor would be designated to interview the applicant in his or her home. The visitors were volunteers, generally men and women from the upper classes or people from the ranks of the emerging professional and business classes. While the work required experience and skill, proposals to hire full-time, paid visitors met with resistance from people in positions of power.</p>
	
	<p>A visitor’s first task was to classify the applicant as either “deserving” or “undeserving” poor.</p>
	
	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">Deserving poor. </span>People designated as deserving poor were seen as being of good moral character and only temporarily out of luck through no fault of their own. The deserving poor did not ask directly for help, and were clean and tidy.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">Undeserving poor. </span>The undeserving poor were those individuals deemed to be lazy or morally degenerate.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Once an applicant was judged to be deserving, he or she had to appear before a committee of trustees, who made the final decision to grant aid. The board granted aid in only about half of the cases determined to be circumstances of destitution.</p>
	
	<p>In Canada in the early nineteenth century, relief was provided primarily by private philanthropic societies. Organizations such as the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor of St. John’s (1808), the Society for Promoting Education and Industry among the Indians and Destitute Settlers in Canada (1827), the Kingston Benevolent Society (1821), the Halifax Poor Man’s Friend Society (1820), and the Montréal Ladies’ Benevolent Society (1832) were preoccupied with the termination of begging and the value of labour. Relief, rarely provided as cash but rather in the form of food or other necessities, was usually given in return for work. These same organizations, however, resisted the introduction of more scientific methods of charity that were advocated from the 1830s onwards (Rooke and Schnell, 1983: 46–56). (The topic of “scientific philanthropy” will be discussed later in this chapter.)</p>
	
	<p>The relief provided by the volunteers of numerous charities and church parishes was soon deemed disorganized and inefficient, as there was very little regulation or coordination. Toronto alone had 43 different charity organizations by 1894. Over time, these agencies developed training programs for their volunteers, which formed the basis for the University of Toronto’s Social Services Program, established in 1914.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Charity Organisation Society</p>

	<p>In 1869, proponents of better organization for charitable assistance in England formed the London-based<span class="span-keyword text--red"> Charity Organisation Society (COS)</span> to coordinate the efforts of the various charities. The COS brought order to the chaos created by the activities of 640 charitable institutions. The voluntary work conducted under the auspices of the COS was possibly the most widespread attempt to help the poor. Workers in this organization were expected to cooperate with other charities and with the agents of the Poor Law.</p>

	<p>The COS believed that indiscriminate material relief would cause pauperism: it could lure a person from thrift and hard work into a life of dependency and reliance on handouts. The COS believed that the charity visitors could serve as models of the value of hard work and thrift.</p>

	<p>However, these visitors encountered many difficulties and soon sought out specific training and “scientific methods” to cope with them. As these visitors became more familiar with standardized techniques of providing assistance, they began practising what came to be called social “casework” (Copp, 1974: 108–120).</p>

	<p>The popularity of the COS stemmed partly from the relief it accorded to local taxpayers; money could be saved if private charities used unpaid volunteers and members of religious orders (Blyth, 1972: 21). The COS was renamed the Family Welfare Association in 1946 and still operates in Britain today as Family Action, a registered family-support charity.</p>

	<p>The Protestant Charity Organization Society arrived in Montréal in 1901, following an earlier effort to organize a charity in Toronto. It was primarily directed by businessmen and upper-class women who believed that poverty was the fault of the individual.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Settlement House Movement</p>

	<p>The aspect of social work concerned with community work has its roots in the <span class="span-keyword text--red">settlement house movement</span>. The term derived from the notion of “settling in,” whereby relief workers would take up residence in the very neighbourhoods they were helping. The purpose of settlement houses was to bring the youth of the educated middle class and the charitable gentry to live among urban residents—a kind of mission to the poor. Canon Barnett, the founder of the movement in England, explained that the idea was “to bridge the gap that industrialism had created between rich and poor, to reduce the mutual suspicion and ignorance of one class for the other, and to do something more than give charity…. They would make their settlement an outpost of education and culture” (Davis, 1967: 6).The first settlement house was established in the east end of London in 1884. It was named Toynbee Hall, after Arnold Toynbee, an Oxford University historian who had settled in the same neighbourhood and had died in 1883.</p>

	<p>From the 1880s through to the 1930s, the settlement house movement was a major factor in the emergence of social work. Jane Addams was the most prominent American to transport the idea of social settlements to the United States, founding Hull House in Chicago in 1889. William Lyon Mackenzie King, later to become prime minister of Canada, worked at Hull House in the 1890s, learning about the charitable work of Addams and others (Addams, 1961: viii; Ferns and Ostry, 1976: 37). Evangelia, the first settlement house in Toronto, was founded in 1902 by Libby Carson and Mary Bell with the support of the Toronto YWCA. Carson had founded several other settlement houses, including Christadora House in New York in 1897.</p>

	<p>Several other settlement houses were established in Canada during this period. In Winnipeg, J.S. Woodsworth (who later became the first leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party) directed the All People’s Mission, which was founded in 1907. In Montréal, the University Settlement House was established in 1909; and in Toronto, the University Settlement was founded in 1910, the Central Neighbourhood House in 1911, and the St. Christopher House in 1912. Most large Canadian cities had at least one settlement house by World War I. The first schools of social work in Canada were connected to, or often were started by, settlement workers (Davis, 1967: 3–25).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Dawning of Public Welfare</p>

	<p>Social work occurs within a socio-political environment, and, therefore, understanding the historical context ensures an appreciation of the roots and progression of social work practice. The shifts and tensions within social welfare and social work practice in Canada have been influenced by historical developments in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>A renowned (now retired) social work professor at the University of British Columbia, Dennis T. Guest, provides a complete history of social welfare in Canada in his book, The Emergence of Social Security in Canada (3rd edition, 1997). This in-depth study offers shrewd insights into the nuts and bolts of social policy development in Canada. Relying heavily on Guest’s work, this chapter provides an overview of some critical junctures in the socio-political environment and the eventual consequences for Canadian social work practice.</p>

	<p>Canada has its own unique history, in part reflecting the ideology of socialism, which combines the liberal ideology of maximizing individual freedom and liberty with the feudal or conservative values concerned with the group aspects of human life (Guest, 1997: 18). The ideological spectrum, as it is presented in Canadian history, is markedly different from that in the United States. The Canadian ideological spectrum “emphasizes the notion of equality of condition through cooperative, collective actions, displacing the liberal emphasis on equality of opportunity with its connotation of competitive struggle” (Guest, 1997: 18). The rest of this chapter explores major historical influences on the evolution of social work throughout the twentieth century and the early part of the twenty-first century.</p>

	<p>World War I (1914-1918), in particular, produced profound changes in the social and economic structure of Canada. The federal government began to assume a role in moulding social and economic resources, by imposing, for example, a federal income tax on personal income. “The government became the sole support of hundreds of disabled soldiers, their wives and children, and the widows and orphans of the men killed in battle” (Guest, 1997: 49).</p>

	<p>Increased attention to the plight of one-parent families, alongside lobbying by women’s organizations, led to the provision of Mothers’ Pensions. Initially residual in nature, this program eventually became a mother’s allowance program in all provinces. Programs such as this one foreshadowed public welfare programs, given their centralized administrative structures, specially trained staff, and funding supplied by provincial treasuries. These programs replaced the previous capricious discretionary power of local poor-relief administration (Guest, 1997: 64).</p>

	<p>The first five decades of the twentieth century, however, continued to be influenced by values related to individualism; according to this ideology, poverty was seen as a result of personal failing or character weakness. Some may argue that remnants of that ideology persist today.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">At the Turn of the Twentieth Century: The Era of Social Reform</p>

	<p>As the twentieth century approached, urbanization and industrialization accelerated. Canadian political figure J.S. Woodsworth summed up this phenomenon: “Canada is leaving the country for the city.” Social reformers became increasingly appalled by the exploitation of children and the risks to safety in work sites that were often more like detention centres.</p>

	<p>Public discourse began to focus on the relationship between government and its citizens, and public opinion underwent marked transformations. “The doctrines of laissez-faire and of individualism were being challenged by notions of social justice, by a concern for the well-being of the group and of the wider interests of the community as a whole” (Guest, 1997: 26).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red ">The Emergence of the Notion of a Social Minimum</p>

	<p>Gradually, the notion of a <span class="span-keyword text--red">social minimum </span>began to emerge. This viewpoint maintains that a political community should seek to ensure that its members can all enjoy at least a minimally decent standard of living. At the turn of the twentieth century, social reform became a multi-faceted public issue. Free public education and public libraries were established in larger Canadian cities and towns, and government entered into the field of public health, initially to combat outbreaks of cholera, smallpox, and typhoid. Work conditions were regulated.</p>

	<p>In 1897, one of the first social survey research studies was carried out by H.B. Ames in Montréal. Published under the title The City Below the Hill, the study illuminated the conditions of the poorest residents of Montréal. Other studies by social reformers, such as J.J. Kelso in Toronto and J.S. Woodsworth in Winnipeg, contributed to an understanding of poverty and what could be done to alleviate it. These studies led to an emerging urban reform movement.</p>

	<p><span class="span-keyword text--red">Scientific philanthropy</span> was a movement first undertaken in England in the 1860s by members of the Protestant social and economic elite in an effort to curtail urban poverty and begging. The notion of scientific philanthropy departed from moral judgements of deservedness and was rooted instead in the ideals of social reform and progress that were becoming popular at the time. A person in need was now seen as having an objective problem, and the role of the relief worker was to help him or her deal with the problem. Gathering factual information would lead to an understanding of the causes of the person’s problem, and in turn, to a solution. The theory underlying scientific philanthropy was that “the scientific spirit pointed toward self-correction and consensus” (Leiby, 1978: 91).</p>

	<p>The gradual shift from private charity work toward more social scientific methods occurred more or less at the same time in Britain, the United States, and Canada. Between 1877 and 1920, scientific charity spread rapidly to most northeastern and midwestern large- and medium-sized cities in the United States, and from there, to Canada.</p>

	<p>In addition to the social survey research studies mentioned above, the federal government launched scientific inquiries into the factors underlying social ills and disparities. Royal Commissions, such as the Dominion Commission on the Relations of Labour and Capital (1889), the Ontario Royal Commission on the Prisons (1890), and the Dominion Board of Inquiry into the Cost of Living (1915), also contributed to increased awareness of the social causes of poverty and inequity and a growing interest in social service and social work.</p>

	<p>Eventually, the shift to scientific philanthropy provided the foundation for the birth of social work as a profession.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Rise of Trained Social Workers</p>

	<p><span class="span-keyword text--red">Modern casework</span>—the use of systematic methods of investigation, assessment, and decision making in social work practice—was strongly influenced by Mary Richmond (1861–1928), who worked for the Charity Organisation Societies of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Richmond argued that the casework technique could approach a “scientific understanding of social dynamics and human behaviour” (Pitsula, 1979: 39). Her 1917 text, Social Diagnosis, was used in the training of relief workers, and its contents reflect “the strong influence played by medicine in Miss Richmond’s conception of social casework” (Coll, 1973: 85–86). In Social Diagnosis, Richmond describes the social work process as follows:</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet-item">1) Collection of social data on family history, and data pertaining to the problem at hand;</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">2) Critical examination of the material, leading to diagnosis; and</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">3) Development of a case plan with the involvement of the client.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>In her analysis of social work, Richmond used the term “diagnosis” deliberately, borrowing the term from medicine. Her thinking became the basis of what would become known as the “medical model” of social work.</p>

	<p>The Social Service Commission in Toronto first introduced the practice of professional casework in Canada. The Commission was appointed by the city in 1911, and employed staff who were paid for their work. It requested that the House of Industry in Toronto hire paid staff to operate their relief program. The distribution of relief was coordinated according to modern social work principles, as described in the Commission’s 1916 annual report:</p>

	<p><em>Distress is relieved with care and sympathy, but the emphasis is not placed on mere relief giving. With each family helped, the work includes co-operation with other agencies, diagnosis of need, decision as to remedy, application of remedy, subsequent care, and tabulation of results. This is not haphazard “tinkering” with human beings but a real effort to render constructive and progressive service (Social Service Commission, 1916).</em></p>

	<p>In 1914, the University of Toronto established a Department of Social Services for the scientific study of society. This was the first program in Canada to undertake the task of training social workers. In 1918, McGill University opened Canada’s second English-language social work training program, the School of Social Study and Training.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Shift from Moral to Social Reform</p>

	<p>After World War I (1914-1918), the emergent social work profession was called upon to assist with the resettlement of war veterans and with others who were not poor but who needed assistance. In 1918, Charlotte Whitton was chosen to assist the Reverend J.G. Shearer at the Social Service Council of Canada, and she thus began a period of 25 years of intense involvement in social work and in the development of the social services. By 1921, the Social Service Council had become the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Public Health, illustrating the shift from the premise of moral to social reform.</p>

	<p>In fact, social work gradually became a secular and scientific alternative to moral and religious endeavours to help disadvantaged members of society. As this replacement occurred during the early part of the twentieth century, however, religious faith continued to be central to the practice of a great deal of social work, as the next section describes.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Gospel, Social Work, and Social Action</p>

	<p>During this era of social reform, Canadian social work was strongly influenced by the <span class="span--keyword text--red">Social Gospel movement.</span> In the latter part of the nineteenth century, campaigns for a more socially oriented church, one that would apply Christian ethics to social problems, began to appear within the major Protestant churches. Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist church members pushed for a &ldquo;social gospel&rdquo; concerned with justice and social action. Their interests included social inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, the environment, child labour, labour rights, education, and the impending danger of war. Black denominations, especially the African Methodist Episcopal church (AME) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church (AMEZ), actively supported the movement, as well.</p>

<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

	<p>The Social Gospel wings of these churches started many of the settlement houses in Canada, offering services such as daycare, education, and health care to needy people in poor neighborhoods. The YMCA, which had been created mid-century to help rural youth adjust to the city without losing their religion, had by the 1890s become a powerful instrument of the Social Gospel movement.</p>

	<p>In 1907, the main Protestant churches established the Moral and Social Reform League. The League became the Social Service Council of Canada in 1914, with the Reverend J.G. Shearer serving as its first director. The Council remained the main social service advocacy organization in Canada for the next 20 years. Several leading members of Canada&rsquo;s trade union movement were active in the Council. After 1925, however, it declined in significance and was replaced by the Canadian Association of Social Workers in 1927.</p>

	<p>The Social Gospel movement had especially strong supporters in Canada&rsquo;s prairie provinces. J.S. Woodsworth was born in Ontario in 1874 and was raised in Manitoba. He became interested in social welfare work while studying at Oxford University in England. He returned to Canada, took a position as a Methodist minister in Winnipeg, and began working with the city&rsquo;s poor immigrants. He helped develop the efforts of social workers there, which then spread to other parts of Canada. Woodsworth founded and served as secretary of the Social Welfare League in 1913. As part of the settlement house movement, he created the All People&rsquo;s Mission, which provided a variety of direct social services. He campaigned for compulsory education, juvenile courts, and the construction of playgrounds. In the 1930s, Woodsworth and Alberta MP William Irvine founded the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), later the New Democratic Party, on Social Gospel principles. The CCF, led by Tommy Douglas (himself a Baptist minister), took power in Saskatchewan in 1944 and introduced universal medicare, family allowance, and old-age pensions.</p>

	<p>Social Gospel reformers such as Woodsworth were greatly influenced by (and greatly influenced) the Canadian labour movement, particularly with regard to worker control of enterprises and workers&rsquo; direct participation in decision making.</p>

	<p>In the churches, this spirit manifested itself as the social gospel, implying the achievement of justice in this world rather than in the next. For these reformers, service to other human beings was considered a form of service to God. Many Canadian historians, such as Ramsey Cook (1985), view social work as the secular replacement of the social gospel movement.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work and the Great Depression of the 1930s</p>

	<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s left an indelible mark on Canadian society and on the emerging social work profession. This was an extremely difficult time of mass unemployment, widespread hardship, and seriously reduced living standards. In 1933, for example, nearly one quarter of the labour force was unemployed. For many Canadians, the Depression shattered forever the idea that market forces should be left unregulated. Most people came to view unemployment as a socio-economic problem requiring a national response, rather than as a personal problem to be solved by charity. During this period, attitudes changed greatly, as did Canadian political life. The late 1920s and the 1930s saw intense class conflict, as well as trade union development and militancy.</p>

	<p>This period saw remarkable growth in the number of social workers. The 1941 census recorded 1,805 social workers in Canada, which represented a 65 percent increase from 1931. During this decade, expanding social service agencies administered relief to a large percentage of the population. &ldquo;During the harsh social conditions of the winter of 1931,&rdquo; note social historians Therese Jennissen and Colleen Lundy, &ldquo;social workers were overburdened with people in need&rdquo; (Jennissen and Lundy, 2006).</p>

	<p>The Great Depression played a significant role in the shaping of Canada&rsquo;s welfare state and in the expansion of the social work profession. It ultimately led to the establishment of government-funded social programs and a growing need for trained social workers to run these programs. Today, social workers are employed in a variety of fields, serving many diverse populations, and the profession continues to pursue its mission of achieving social justice and ensuring the welfare of all Canadians.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Mid-Twentieth Century: The Era of Applied Social Science</p>
	
	<p>During World War II (1939-1945), the Canadian federal and provincial governments began to realize that social services were not a luxury, but a vital part of a smoothly functioning economy. These services were required to assist the many returning war veterans and their families. The war ended a period of massive unemployment, sped up industrialization and urbanization, doubled the number of women in the labour force, and increased, and legitimized, government intervention in the economy.</p>

	<p>In the post&ndash;World War II period, a time of rapid economic growth and mass consumption, career opportunities for social workers began to open up. As a more scientific view of human services emerged, the education of social workers gradually shifted from agency-based, volunteer training to a university-based, professional formal education. Originally based on the concept of charity, social work had evolved from a set of rules to guide volunteers helping the poor into a philosophy that embodied many of the principles of modern casework and techniques that could be transmitted by education and training (Woodroofe, 1962: 54). Social work in Canada had gained professional prominence in 1927 when the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) was established. In 1947, the first professional social work degree (Master of Social Work) was offered by the University of Toronto. In 1966, the university awarded the first Bachelor of Social Work degree (Armitage, 1970).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Aftermath of World War II</p>

	<p>Following World War II, the federal Liberal government legislated a series of social welfare measures that were, in retrospect, seemingly intended to forestall the election of more CCF party members to the House of Commons. The CCF had achieved considerable popularity during the war with a social reform platform. The Liberals were also concerned with the possibility of a recession, which could cause considerable social unrest. The federal government therefore introduced the Family Allowance, which put more funds into the hands of families, helping to spur more economic growth. In 1951, through a constitutional amendment, the federal government introduced a federally financed and administered universal Old Age Pension. Several years later, they introduced benefit programs for persons with disabilities.(See Chapter 13 for more information about this topic.)</p>

	<p>Many of these programs led to the expansion of employment in the administration of new services and programs, precipitating a fundamental change in the nature of Canadian social work and the emergence of a profession. Social work opportunities were now shifting from mainly private, volunteer agencies to government departments or government-financed agencies.</p>

	<p>The ideas of Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) had an impact on how social workers practised their profession during this period. Debate occurred between the adherents of the Freudian or diagnostic approach and the newer functional approach. In the diagnostic approach, emphasis was placed on understanding the psychic condition of the individual by reference to causal events in his or her early life. This approach required a skilled worker who could diagnose the problem and carry out a plan for treatment.</p>

	<p>The functional approach was based more on the belief in the potential of clients to determine their own direction in life with the assistance of a skilled social worker. The role of the worker was to establish a sound, structured relationship with the client and thereby to facilitate a process of personal change (Goldstein, 1973: 38&ndash;39).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">New Models of Social Work Practice Emerge</p>

	<p>In the 1960s, the social work profession renewed its interest in poverty as a result of anti-poverty measures instituted by the federal government. Community organizing initiatives sprang up in major cities across the country. In Ontario, a second generation of more radical social workers unionized, forming the Federation of Children&rsquo;s Aid Staff in the early 1970s. Several years later, this group of unions joined the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which today represents a large number of social workers who are employed by municipalities across the country.</p>

	<p>A range of new models of social work practice also appeared in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the generic or integrated approach, the problem-solving approach, the behaviour modification approach, and the structural approach. The latter was based, in part, on a critique of approaches to individual and family social work that tended to seek explanations for and solutions to problems within the individual alone and not within the institutions or structures of society. (See Chapter 4.)</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Expansion of Social Services and Social Work</p>

	<p>Despite the economic expansion of the post-war years, demands on private organizations for relief grew. The few church and private charities could not keep up. Pressure was put on the federal government by these organizations and by the Canadian Welfare Council, which presented the case for a national program of support for those who were unemployed but not eligible for other assistance.</p>

	<p>The 1956 Unemployment Insurance Act provided federal assistance to the provinces for the so-called unemployed but employable person who did not have access to other income security programs or employment income. A condition of this assistance was that the province could not impose a residency requirement on an applicant.</p>

	<p>This federal legislation marked the beginning of modernization of relief administration, which led to the passage of the Canada Assistance Plan in 1966. By offering to share 50 percent of the provincial costs of welfare and social services, the federal government effected key changes in Social Assistance, transforming it into a publicly financed and administered program. This was accompanied by a rapid expansion of social services in child welfare, child care, and other services for people in need.</p>

	<p>The period from 1963 to 1973 saw the expansion of income security and social service programs. By the end of this period, Canada had become a welfare state with a public system of health and hospital care and expanded or new income security programs for children, the unemployed, single parents, and persons with disabilities.</p>

	<p>Public or publicly financed social services, including child welfare and child care, were also expanded, many of which were extended for the first time to meet the needs of the Indigenous population, including those on reserves. Social workers were required to administer these new programs and deliver the expanded services. The number of persons who identified themselves as social workers in the census rose from 3,495 in 1951 to 30,535 in 1971; most of that increase occurred in the decade following 1961.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Increasing Demand for Social Work Programs</p>

	<p>This increased demand for trained social work staff led to increased enrolment in college and university social work programs. The Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (CASSW) was established in 1967 to oversee professional university-based education programs in Canada. Currently, there are 34 universities and 46 colleges providing social work and social service education. Social workers now earn wages that are comparable to nurses and teachers, with hospitals and child welfare agencies currently employing the largest numbers of social workers.</p>

	<p>At its inception, casework was the predominant form of social work practice, but by the mid-twentieth century both group work and community work were added to approaches to social work. Additionally, some universities have recognized social administration and social policy as important areas of practice. By the 1970s, there was a proliferation of approaches that included both diagnostic and functional approaches, as well as the generalist, the problem-solving, and the structural approaches&mdash;all testifying to the importance of the field of social work to the Canadian society and economy. (Chapter 3 will explore the characteristics of these approaches in greater detail.)</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Regulating the Social Work Profession</p>

	<p>Today, each Canadian province and territory has legislation governing the practice of social work. The primary purpose of regulatory legislation is to protect the public through the oversight of social work practice. Provincial/territorial legislation governs who can use the title of social worker, requires a public register of regulated social workers, and outlines a process for investigating complaints. In most Canadian jurisdictions, the social work profession&rsquo;s regulatory body is separate from its advocacy association. </p>

	<p>The British Columbia Social Workers Act (2008) serves to control the titles &ldquo;Registered Social Worker&rdquo; (R.S.W.) and &ldquo;Social Worker,&rdquo; allowing exemptions for certain situations. The Act established the British Columbia College of Social Workers, which maintains a continuing competence program to promote high standards of practice. It also stipulates the requirements for full registration as a social worker, including the successful completion of an exam. </p>

	<p>Similarly, in Manitoba, The Social Work Profession Act (2009), proclaimed into law in 2014, oversees professional designations to protect the public interest and promote public confidence in the profession of social work. The Manitoba College of Social Workers also recently introduced a continuing competence program, with the first reporting cycle to begin in 2017. </p>

	<p>The Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers protects the interest of the public by regulating social work practice through the Social Work and Social Service Work Act (1998). This Act also stipulates a mandatory continuing competence program. Hearings of the College&rsquo;s Discipline Committee are posted and open to the public.</p>

	<p>The Late Twentieth Century: The Erosion of the Welfare State</p>
	<p>In 1980, the Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, resumed office during a period of double-digit inflation and a severe economic recession. The social policy field was dominated by efforts to restrain public expenditure (Guest, 1997: 190). In 1984, the Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, took office. Their cost-containment measures led to a decline in the living standards of low- and moderate-income Canadians. Following the 1980s, advanced capitalist countries such as Canada systematically began to dismantle the welfare state, as responsibiltiy for the well-being of citizens shifted from the community to individuals and families. Much of the social welfare foundation established in Canada after World War II began to unravel.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Starve the Beast&rdquo;/&rdquo;Death by Deficit &ldquo;</p>
	<p>The rise of what has been coined &ldquo;neo-liberalism&rdquo; characterized this period. Advocates of neo-liberalism supported extensive privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, and reductions in government spending to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy. Overall, the period from around 1980 to the present has been characterized by greater global economic integration, sweeping cutbacks in social services, and increasingly strong, ideological arguments for greater fiscal restraint.</p>
	<p>American President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s slogan of the day was to &ldquo;starve the beast&rdquo;&shy;&mdash;meaning the government&mdash;and to provide tax breaks for the wealthy. They would, in turn, reinvest their wealth and grow the economy, or so the argument went. This argument was not lost on Canadian politicians at the time. In Canada, this era was referred to as &ldquo;death by deficit.&rdquo; The economic downturn of 2008&mdash;the fault of corporate greed&mdash;served to encourage still further cutbacks in government spending on health, education, and social welfare.</p>
	<p>This period saw increasing income inequality, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. In many nations, especially poorer ones, economic restructuring and cutbacks to social programs have been imposed by international agencies, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in the form of so-called &ldquo;structural adjustments.&rdquo; The Canadian government was not immune to these pressures. It reduced its own income security programs to meet the new economic order and to compete with other nations to be &ldquo;investor-friendly.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Less Power to the People</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the impact of globalization on Canada&rsquo;s income security programs was felt mainly by the most disadvantaged members of our society&mdash;people who are impoverished and homeless. They were also the ones who were least able to fight back. Cutbacks and strict eligibility criteria meant that many people were often left without the bare necessities of life. </p>
	<p>And for the middle class, high-paying jobs were moving offshore to corporate tax havens or export processing zones. Welfare cutbacks meant that ordinary working Canadians might not be able to depend on the traditional social protection offered by such programs as Employment Insurance and Old Age Security.</p>
	<p>Globalization also meant that national and local governments had less and less freedom to act on behalf of their citizens, especially on the big economic and social questions of the day. The fight to gain and maintain global human rights in the face of economic globalization became, in many respects, the modern epic struggle. And advocacy for equality within and between nations became an integral part of social welfare.</p>
	<p>Changes in Social Work Practice</p>
	<p>Overall, changes in government policy were reflected in changes of emphasis within the social work profession. During this period of cutbacks and restraint, welfare programs became less universal and more targeted toward specific categories of individuals and families. There was increased emphasis on demonstrating quantifiable, measurable results and on justifying every public dollar spent. Scientific management techniques and tighter control of public funding imposed new ways of thinking onto the health professions, including social work, where the client&rsquo;s needs were no longer necessarily at the top of the list. To be sure, some of the efficiency measures were for the better, but the severity of the cutbacks was detrimental to those most in need and resulted in increased pressure on already-overburdened social workers.</p>
	<p>Major Influences and Shifts in the Profession</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the aging of the baby boom generation (people born between 1945 and 1965) caused social work to expand and enhance services for older adults. These included services to prevent elder abuse; interventions for people with dementia; palliative care; and services that promote independence for seniors. Trauma treatment expanded from care for military personnel returning from war to care for clients experiencing severe traumatic events that left them feeling depressed and anxious. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) became an increasingly common diagnosis. And finally, new waves of refugees arriving from war zones, such as Syria, presented new challenges and new opportunities for social workers.</p>
	<p>New technologies such as desktop computers and the Internet were integrated into social work practice in the 1990s, and the impact of technology intensified in the 2000s. Online education and counselling, Telehealth, and practice-based databases increasingly affected how social work was organized and carried out.</p>
	<p>As another noticeable shift in practice, social workers became increasingly involved in bullying prevention programs throughout Canada. A highly significant turning point in this area took place in the mid-1970s with the work of Dan Olweus. The 1999 Columbine High School&#160;shooting in Colorado, the high-profile suicides of young persons who had been bullied, and increasing reports of cyberbullying caused schools to take notice of this serious issue. Government legislation followed, with the Bullying Act of 2012 in Ontario and Bill 56 in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
	<p>Anti-oppressive practice became more prevalent in schools of social work. It was well understood that some groups in society were excluded from social resources and had fewer choices than other groups. Women, Indigenous people, youth, older adults, racialized Canadians, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community all possessed a less powerful voice in Canadian society compared to white, male, middle-aged, able-bodied heterosexual individuals. Anti-oppressive practice emphasized social justice, social change, and empowerment through analysis and advocacy at both the macro and micro levels of oppression.</p>
	<p>Similarly, social work interventions increasingly focused on risk assessments and structured treatment protocols, which were accompanied by the emergence of practice-focused micro- level theories such as systems theory, narrative therapy, and crisis intervention models. More recently, new theoretical practice models such as mindfulness-based interventions and evidence-based practice have emerged. Other trends that affected social work included a greater focus on the field of children&rsquo;s mental health, treatment for gambling, Internet-based social work education, and treatment of substance use disorders .</p>
	<p>The Twenty-First Century&mdash;What Lies Ahead?</p>
	<p>In February 2006, Stephen Harper became the twenty-second prime minister of Canada, and the first prime minister representing the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Conservative Party of Canada, which was formed when the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance (the origins of which were in the Reform Party of Canada) joined forces. In 2008, a major economic recession occurred. This global financial crisis has had serious and costly repercussions to this day. What followed was a drastic continuation of the systematic dismantling of social programs. This leaner, meaner approach to social policy changed Canada for the worse, claimed former Saskatchewan premier Roy Romanow, and chipped away at programs that had helped define the compassionate and caring Canada that had evolved over several generations.</p>
	<p>Romanow, who had headed a royal commission on health care in 2002, predicted that the cuts the Harper Conservative government made would result in a more inequitable nation. Federal health-care spending was reined in, the age of eligibility for Old Age Security was increased by two years, Employment Insurance eligibility criteria were tightened, Indigenous and environmental organizations received less support, and advocacy groups for child care, women&rsquo;s health, and support for immigrants were all adversely affected. NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair stated that, &ldquo;Families are getting hit three times at once: they&rsquo;re getting fewer services, a bigger share of the tax bill, and declining incomes.&rdquo; In short, Mulcair stated &ldquo;we&rsquo;re becoming the first generation in our country&rsquo;s history to leave our children and grandchildren with a lower quality of life than we inherited from our parents.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>In 2015, one in seven people in Canada lived in poverty; 250,000 people were homeless and emergency shelters were at maximum capacity; socio-economic disparities accounted for</p>
	<p>20 percent of total annual health-care spending; food bank usage had Increased by 25 percent since the 2008&ndash;2009 economic recession; there were only enough child-care spaces for</p>
	<p>20 percent of young children; and precarious employment (insecure, unpredictable, low wage, and few benefits) had increased by nearly 50 percent over the last 20 years. And yet, there was still no national poverty plan.</p>
	<p>Growing the Middle Class</p>
	<p>In 2015, Justin Trudeau (the eldest son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau) led the Liberal Party of Canada to a majority government on a platform dedicated to &ldquo;growing the middle class.&rdquo; The 2016 federal budget defined a new vision for Canada&rsquo;s economy: &ldquo;Canada as a centre of global innovation.&rdquo; It proposed creating jobs through infrastructure planning, investing in public transit and green infrastructure, and sustaining healthy communities through new clean water and waste-water infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The budget expanded affordable housing, housing for seniors, and shelter for victims of violence, as well as projects such as the Housing First Initiatives that help homeless Canadians secure stable housing. In addition, $500 million was dedicated to supporting a National Framework on Early Learning and Child Care, of which 20 percent was allocated for Indigenous child care on reserves. Investment in Indigenous Community Infrastructure was a clearly announced priority in the 2016 budget, with a historically high investment of $3.5 billion over five years for green and social infrastructure. The budget appeared to respond to the underlying social determinants of health. Only time will tell whether increasing the deficit will work, and whether these priorities will decrease social and health inequities among Canadians.</p>
	<p>Emerging Social Movements: Finding Allies</p>
	<p>Social workers have an ethical responsibility to advocate for social justice, and many social workers focus on influencing public policy, participating in political action, and organizing group activism. In the first decades of the twenty-first century, many traditionally oppressed groups, whose members are politically astute and adept at using social media, have found a distinct voice and are mobilizing for social change.</p>
	<p>These modern social movements focus on global and environmental issues, and they collaborate with grassroots organizations to respond to the oppressive political, economic, and social contexts of our daily lives. Rather than simply building coalitions across single issues or lowest-common-denominator politics, these movements are effecting a deepening of interconnected and intersectional analysis that draws strength from each movement and that represents more than the sum of its parts.</p>
	<p>Idle No More</p>
	<p>The Idle No More (INM) movement was initially a series of teach-ins to protest parliamentary bills in Saskatchewan that threatened to erode Indigenous sovereignty environmental protection. The movement quickly became one of the largest Indigenous mass movements in Canadian history&mdash;sparking hundreds of rallies and protests across the country. The INM&rsquo;s vision is to build sovereignty and a resurgence of nationhood, to pressure government and industry to protect the environment, and to build allies in order to reframe the nation-to-nation relationship by highlighting grassroots perspectives, issues, and concerns.</p>
	<p>Anti-G20 Mobilization</p>
	<p>Anti-G20 mobilization in Toronto in 2010 marked a resurgence in coordinated movement organization. The logistics involving the coordination of billets and food and creating infrastructure, including legal support, communications, and medics, was a victory in itself. This mobilization linked global anti-capitalist movements in an era of austerity with local community resistance. It brought multiple vulnerable groups together (people of colour, trans folks, racialized and immigrant people, and Indigenous peoples) to form a grassroots anti-colonial migrant justice group protesting against the indignity of poverty, a lack of inclusive services, repressive immigration policies, and environmental degradation.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Leave coal in the hole, leave oil in the soil, leave tar sands in the land&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Environmental justice movements are on the upswing in Canada. Many Canadians and Indigenous communities are proclaiming themselves to be ardent environmentalists. Active resistance against the Alberta Tar Sands and the Enbridge Pipeline is ongoing in British Columbia. Localized movements have protested corporate development and environmental degradation. For example, Mohawks in Kanesatake, Qu&eacute;bec, rejected a niobium mine; the Okanagan Indian Band in British Columbia staged a blockade against Tolko Industries logging in their watershed; fishers in Prince Edward Island filed a lawsuit against British Petroleum for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that interfered with the northern migration of tuna; the Halalt First Nation blockaded the Chemainus River to protect their aquifers; environmentalists repeatedly opposed the Raven Underground Coal Project in the Comox Valley of British Columbia; Innu communities erected a blockade against New Millennium Capital and Labrador Iron Mines Holdings; and highway developments from Gateway in British Columiba to the Humbolt Highway in Saskatchewan have met with organized resistance.</p>
