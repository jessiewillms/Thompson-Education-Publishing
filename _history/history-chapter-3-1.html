<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
    <p>A social work theory, like any other theory, is a set of ideas that attempts to explain and make predictions about a particular issue or phenomenon. A theory tries to capture the essence of a phenomenon or problem. For example, Abraham Maslow’s theory of the “hierarchy of needs” asserts that we have certain basic needs to fulfill: “physiological,” “safety,” “belongingness,” “love,” “esteem,” “self-actualization,” and “self-transcendence.” Maslow asserted that these needs progress from the basic necessities of survival through a hierarcy toward spiritual requirements for life satisfaction and self-realization. From this theoretical understanding, certain practical interventions can follow, and outcomes can be tested in real life.</p>
    <p>In Western social work, it is helpful to distinguish between two broad categories of theory:</p>
    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--red span-keyword">Foundational theories/perspectives.</span>These theories comprise general explanations about the underlying makeup and workings of our society. They can focus on personality and behaviour, people in society, or social, political, and economic relationships. They draw from foundational disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and the allied health professions. Examples include ecological theory, cognitive theory, systems theory, structural theory, and critical theory (discussed later in this chapter).</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--red span-keyword">Practice theories/models.</span>These models are built on foundational theories, but they are specific to how social work is practised in real-world contexts. While they are based on foundational theories (e.g., human development theory), practice theories or models focus on factors that are important for practitioners in assessing a client’s situation and working with a client to determine the most effective intervention. Examples include client-centred models, task-centred models, strengths-based models, cognitive behaviourial therapy, mindfulness, and narrative therapy—all of which are explained later in this chapter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Social work theory focuses on explaining, understanding, and predicting human behaviour in different socio-economic and cultural contexts and on identifying patterns to guide interventions. Some theories are foundational, and some are more specific to social work practice.</p>
    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Integration of Theory and Practice</p>
    <p>Social work is an applied professional field. Its theories inform action (practice), provide a framework for the main tasks of social work (assessment, planning, intervention, and follow-up), and help identify gaps in knowledge about practice (Gentle-Genitty et al., 2014).</p>
    <p>The reverse is also true. Theoretical knowledge is developed and enhanced through hands-on practice—that is, through social work research, interaction, and dialogue (Fook and Victoria, 2000; Parton, 2000). Just as in the natural sciences, research (comparable to practice) is used to test hypotheses that in turn lead practitioners to deeper theoretical insights and higher levels of knowledge. Indeed, it has been suggested that social work is distinguished from other applied fields precisely because of this close relationship between theory and practice (Parton, 2000). Evidence-based practice is explored further in Chapter 4.</p>
    <p>Social work theory can also legitimize voices and ways of knowing that traditionally may have been been minimized, ignored, or excluded (Fook and Victoria, 2000; Parton, 2000). Innovative theorizing can bring to the forefront issues not normally addressed, or not adequately addressed, by more customary approaches. This, in turn, can result in more effective practice outcomes for&#160;clients.</p>
    
    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Theoretical Knowledge, Professional Judgement, and Creativity in Social Work</p>
    
    <p>A social worker’s day-to-day interventions with clients will always be influenced, to some extent, by his or her theoretical preferences (that is, by his or her most valued underlying philosophy or perspective). Social work professor Ben Carniol at Ryerson University suggests that this relationship can best be understood if we categorize theoretical perspectives in terms of broad clusters or groupings. These perspectives range from “conventional” (e.g., ecological, cognitive, and systems approaches to social work) to “progressive” (e.g., structural, critical, and anti-oppressive approaches). Table 3.1 summarizes this way of categorizing the different perspectives and approaches. Keep in mind that this general categorization is not exhaustive or all-inclusive, but rather represents one useful means of organizing and understanding some predominant social work theories.</p>
    <p>It would likely take an entire course to teach students the nature of any particular theory in all its complexity—for example, an ecological (conventional) or an anti-oppressive (progressive) approach. However, while commonalities may exist between certain theoretical perspectives, social work practice recognizes that no one solution fits all client situations. Each client and situation are unique. Social workers need to be “generalists”—they need to learn about and understand a wide array of theories and practice models. Over time, they combine their knowledge with professional judgement and creativity.</p>
    <p>For a generalist social worker, it is the problem at hand that determines the approach, not the other way around. A practitioner might use an individual-level approach when counselling a child who has been sexually abused or when working one-on-one with an individual with a substance use disorder. On a different occasion, in a different context, the same social worker might use a structural-level approach to help a family access child services or to advocate to improve public funding for mental health services. An ecological (or systems) approach will likely not bring about the desired outcome if an anti-oppressive intervention is called for. Likewise, a structural solution will not prove effective if a one-on-one intervention is called for.</p>

	<p>When trying to make sense of the major theoretical perspectives in social work, it is helpful to refer to Table 3.1. This table represents one possible way to organize selected theories in social work into coherent, comprehensible categories. The categories are elaborated more fully later in this chapter in a comprehensive chart entitled &ldquo;Perpectives on Social Work Practice: A Teaching/Practice Overview.&rdquo;</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Ecological Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Ecological theory places the individual within a series of interdependent relationships. This theory is based on the concept of an ecosystem in nature in which every organism is affected by and influences other organisms within the system.</p>

	<p>Ecological theory is a reaction to approaches that locate the cause of problems solely within the individual (as in certain branches of psychology) or solely within the structures of the wider society (as in certain branches of sociology). While the idea of the individual existing within a series of systems has a long history, in the 1980s social work professors Carel Germain and Alex Gitterman used ideas from ecology and biology to develop the &ldquo;life model&rdquo; of social work. This approach is considered a conventional one in social work, as Ben Carniol (2010) has noted, and it still tends to guide much of social work practice today.</p>

	<p>According to ecological theory, individuals exist in particular social environments, and problems arise when there is a lack of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; between people and their environments. People interact in complex relationships and at different levels, such that problems at one level can create difficulties at another level. For example, if an adolescent is having trouble in school, this situation may cause conflict to emerge within the family. This conflict might lead the family to turn for help to a social agency offering services for youth, which can then support the teen in making positive changes in academic performance and relationships at school. Using an ecological approach, social workers examine what might be causing problems in different areas of a person&rsquo;s life, and then work clossely with the client to craft solutions to these problems at different&#160;levels.</p>

	<p>The ecological approach draws upon knowledge of human behaviour as well as knowledge of the influence of social environments on behaviour. When assessing a situation with a client, the social worker maps out the context and decides which component of the situation to focus on first. The goal is to understand how people and their environments mutually influence each other in shaping responses at both individual and social levels. Social workers who rely on this perspective also incorporate aspects of humanist philosophy into their practice, as their work typically involves a strong element of empathy and reflection.</p>

	<p>The ecological approach has obvious strong points. Clearly, individuals do not exist on an isolated island, so some level of systems-based analysis is required to make sense of any situation. However, the approach will be limited in situations in which , for example, systemic factors also play a prominent role&mdash;for example, prejudice and discrimination based on gender, race, or ability. Ignoring the effects of systemic factors when they are present can limit a social worker&rsquo;s ability to intervene on behalf of a client or group of clients.</p>

	<p>Using an ecological approach, the practitioner and the client can begin to separate the various and intricate relationships and components in a client&rsquo;s life that are causing problems and then address them individually or all together.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Cognitive Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Cognitive theory underlies a range of potentially effective intervention strategies, e.g., psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and mindfulness, which have roots in the psychodynamic perspective most often identified with Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s work of the 1920s. Psychodynamic theory and Freud&rsquo;s views are historically important, since they helped to uncover the complexity of the human mind and moved social work practice toward a more open, therapeutic approach, rather than simply instructing people how to live &ldquo;moral&rdquo; lives.</p>

	<p>For example, Freud argued that the norms and values of a society put limits on the extent to which people can actively pursue their basic needs. He suggested that the id, the ego, and the superego work together to fulfill these needs, but only in ways that are acceptable to the society in which we live. There is, he argued, a constant conflict between human desires and the limits set by society, which in turn can lead to anxiety and can cause an individual to act in seemingly irrational ways. Early conscious and unconscious experiences that create these anxieties and the ways in which people manage them are critical in shaping human personality.</p>

	<p>According to the cognitive perspective, the goals of social work are to (1) understand the cognitive roots of anxiety to determine what is fuelling a person&rsquo;s irrational or troubling behaviour, (2) use specific techniques such as &ldquo;talk therapy&rdquo; to expose the source of the problem, and (3) use these insights to resolve the issue, which can then help people manage their anxieties and develop more effective coping behaviours.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Systems Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Whereas the ecological approach focuses on intricate relationships established at the individual level, systems theory (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;ecological systems theory&rdquo;) focuses more on the working (or lack thereof) of wider social systems or structures, such as family, community, school, place of worship, workplace, and so on. (See Figure 3.1.) </p>

	<p>There have been many iterations of systems theory over the years. The key idea is that these systems comprise interrelated parts and constitute an ordered (or disordered) whole, and each part influences other parts of the whole. A breakdown in one system will affect other systems and the persons involved in those systems.</p>

<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
	
	<p>Now let&rsquo;s briefly survey structural, critical, and anti-oppressive theoretical perspectives, widely viewed as relatively &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; compared to some other approaches.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Structural Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Structural theory is largely a Canadian development and can be traced to the work of Maurice Moreau at Carleton University in Ottawa beginning in the 1980s. Structural social work can take several forms. The skills involved in structural social work are similar to the ones used in ecological systems theory. They draw on the same sense of empathy, reflection, and a belief in the basic goodness of people. It is the way in which the social worker analyzes problems&mdash;and the resulting range of actions&mdash;that distinguish the structural approach from traditional systems theory.</p>

	<p>Practitioners of structural social work consider all dimensions of personal problems, while being particularly attuned to the less &ldquo;visible&rdquo; structural elements of these problems, such as social class, race, gender, and ability. While every problem that a client experiences is not entirely caused by societal structures, &ldquo;there is always a structural element in any experienced problem,&rdquo; according to Jan Fook (1993: 74&ndash;75). The structural social worker is concerned with helping the individual deal with a difficult problem, typically resulting from discrimination of some kind, but he or she is also concerned with changing the overall situation that is causing the problem in the first place, as much as possible.</p>

	<p>Structural social work thus goes beyond an analysis of the immediate family and community, and looks to the broader socio-economic factors that underlie personal dilemmas, such as class, gender, age, and ethnicity. Advocates emphasize the links between the client&rsquo;s feelings and behaviours and structural aspects of the larger society. This approach requires the social worker to be skilled in casework, family counselling, group work, and community organizing, as well as knowledgeable about social policy and social welfare issues.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Critical Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Critical theory, broadly speaking, covers a number of more specific structural theories, including feminist theory, anti-racist theory, and post-colonial theory. Critical theory involves an analysis of socio&#8209;economic structures that oppress and exploit people, whether these structures are based on class, race, age, gender, ability, education, or sexuality. Critical social work theory moves beyond understanding and interpretation to criticism of the structure or structures being studied and engagement in action for social transformation (Leonardo, 2004).</p>

	<p>Both as a broad-ranging perspective and as a strategy that acknowledges the client&ndash;worker power imbalance, critical social work draws upon the notion of empowerment. Empowerment at an experiential level has three aspects: (1) explicitly identified power elements in the client&ndash;worker relationship; (2) explicit experience of control by clients; and (3) explicit support by social workers of clients&rsquo; efforts to gain greater control over their lives and promote change.</p>

	<p>Horkheimer (1993), a key contributor to the early development of critical theory, stressed the explanatory and practical aspects of this perspective. Critical theory, he argued, should explain the drawbacks of the current social reality, identify the people who can contribute to change, and provide a clear picture of anticipated social transformation, including detailed norms and achievable goals.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Anti-Oppressive Theory in Social Work</p>

	<p>Anti-oppressive theory is not so much a single theory but rather a cluster of theories that share the goal of understanding and responding to oppressive social conditions and relationships. Feminist and anti-racist social work are two major types of anti-oppressive social work. (These approaches are discussed in greater depth in Chapter 8 and Chapter 10 respectively.)</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Feminist social work.</span> Feminist perspectives in social work emerged in the 1960s and 1970s alongside a growing feminist movement. Feminist theories offer different ways of seeing, asking questions about, and understanding women&rsquo;s lives and experiences, the nature of inequality between the sexes, and gender relations in society. Some theorists have called this a &ldquo;gender-conscious practice&rdquo; (Orbach, 1990). Social workers advocating a feminist approach to practice provide women-centred support and deconstruct how social, economic, and political structures create and sustain gender inequality. Mutual support, respect for diversity, and an emphasis on women&rsquo;s lived experiences guide their work with clients.</li>

		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Anti-racist social work.</span> Anti-racist social work focuses on how racial prejudice and racial discrimination&shy;&mdash;as structural characteristics&mdash;affect the lives of people of colour. Racist attitudes sustain a system of exclusion and marginalization based on observable, physical human features, such as skin colour or hair texture (Henry and Tator, 2006). An anti-racist approach decries the harm that racism does to individuals, families, and entire communities, supports individuals and families who are experiencing racial oppression, and advocates on their behalf. It calls for a wholesale deconstruction of social structures based on racial categorizations of all kinds.</li>

<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

	<p>When it comes to practice, social workers tend to be generalists. That is, while they may (and should) hold strong views and conduct their work broadly on the basis of those views, they are at the same time flexible in their dealings with clients. Each situation is unique. Social workers apply their extensive knowledge and skills creatively and deliberately. They work collaboratively in teams with other health professionals to serve their clients. They adapt their interventions to the situation at hand, drawing on vast professional knowledge and best practices in the field. The interests of their clients are always paramount.</p>

	<p>Generalist social work practice takes place at multiple levels:</p>
	
		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet-item">Micro-level practice focuses on individuals, families, or small groups, aiming to promote healthy personal functioning, social relationships, and interactions with resources.</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">Meso-level practice focuses on formal groups, organizations, and service delivery networks, aiming to promote change in group dynamics, structures, and practices.</li>

			<li class="li--bullet-item">Macro-level practice focuses on social problems in community, institutional, and policy-related contexts (Kirst-Ashman and Hull, 2009; Miller et al., 2008; Miley et al, 2013).</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Social work practitioners also recognize the interactions between these micro, meso, and macro levels of practice (Kirst-Ashman and Hull, 2009). They take advantage of and apply practice manuals and standardized procedures, but they are not unduly limited by these protocols when they appear not to work. Nor is their practice driven solely by rigid, a priori ideas about how things are supposed to work, in theory.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Generalist Intervention Model</p>

	<p>The generalist intervention model is first and foremost tailored to the needs of the client, taking into account how differences in the personal backgrounds of the worker and client may also affect treatment outcomes (Cameron, 2014; Drisko, 2013). This model involves deliberate and &ldquo;planned change.&rdquo; Interventions are based on a careful assessment of the client&rsquo;s situation (problems, needs, and strengths), planning (identifying priorities and objectives), implementation (monitoring progress and revising plans), evaluation of goal attainment, and termination and follow-up (Kirst-Ashman and Hull, 2009).</p>

	<p>Social work practitioners are also attuned to issues and developments in the wider society and within the social work profession itself. These include issues related to professional identity (e.g., licensing and regulation, interdisciplinary relationships) and service delivery (Pearson, 2015). They have knowledge of social work values and ethics, diversity and oppression, cultural competence, social and economic justice, human behaviour, and social welfare policies and programs. They possess a range of skills necessary for micro-, meso-, and macro-level practice, such as communication and interviewing, group facilitation, administration, community mobilization, and research skills (Kirst-Ashman and Hull, 2009). Social work practitioners also demonstrate an aptitude for critical self-evaluation and ongoing self-reflection and assessment (Cameron, 2014; Dorfman, 2013).</p>

	<p>Social work practitioners understand the importance of strong therapeutic client&ndash;worker relationships based on empathy, warmth, genuineness, and trust (Cameron, 2014; Dorfman, 2013). Indeed, many studies show the overriding influence of the client&ndash;worker relationship on successful outcomes, regardless of the technical aspects of the intervention (Drisko, 2013). The client&ndash;worker relationship is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Person in Environment</p>
	
	<p>Social work practice is rooted in a &ldquo;person in environment&rdquo; perspective. This perspective aims first and foremost to enhance interactions between individuals (particularly individuals who are vulnerable or marginalized) and society, as well as to promote social justice and ensure equality of opportunities, access, and participation (Kirst-Ashman and Hull, 2009; Miley et&#160;al, 2013). The focus is on empowerment&shy;&mdash;the enhancement of personal power that enables individuals to take action to improve their situations. Empowerment is achieved by building on client resources, capabilities, strengths, and resiliency.</p>

	<p>Social work practitioners support clients in finding solutions to challenges they are facing and in developing plans that will bring about lasting change. They provide guidance and counselling through clinical intervention and group facilitation, and they support organizational and program development and social planning (e.g., needs assessments/inventories). Generalist practitioners facilitate access to available resources, provide case management, advocate for clients in service delivery and policy systems, mobilize groups for resource or service development and distribution, and engage in activism (e.g., coalitions, legal action, and lobbying) for social change (ibid.). The immediate needs of the client are first and foremost.</p>

	<p>Social workers also function as educators, facilitating the exchange of information, knowledge, and ideas through teaching or training in organizational or institutional settings, through community outreach and awareness raising, and through research (ibid.).</p>

    </div>
</section>
<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

	<p>Social work practitioners are often on the lookout for new ideas and new practice models that will lead to positive outcomes for their clients. They have adapted practice models from psychology and other health-care fields and have also conceptualized new ones. When adapting or integrating new approaches to practice, social workers should always ensure that these approaches align with the profession&rsquo;s mission and values and are grounded in a non-judgemental, anti-oppressive, and empowering philosophy.</p>

	<p>Described below are some empowerment-driven models of practice that have proved helpful to social work professionals in recent years.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Practice Model</p>

	<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the idea that psychological, mental, and emotional distress or disorders are maintained by an individual&rsquo;s cognitive factors. That is, a person&rsquo;s thoughts and beliefs determine their emotional and behavioural responses to life events or situations. Thoughts and beliefs are affected by individual traits, interpersonal relationships, life events, and environmental factors (Miller, 2005).</p>

	<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy differs from traditional psychoanalytical approaches, in which therapists seek the unconscious meaning underlying human behaviour. CBT focuses on using cognitive change as a means of supporting emotional and behavioural change, leading to a person&rsquo;s healthy functioning and goal attainment. CBT involves modifying distorted, irrational, or maladaptive thoughts and beliefs about the self, world, and others, and developing social and behavioural skills that can be applied to all areas of life (Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, n.d.; Gonzales-Prendez and Brisebois, 2012; Hofmann et al., 2012).</p>

	<p>CBT is a frequently used psychotherapeutic intervention tool, and its effectiveness in treating various conditions (including anxiety, stress, anger, and eating disorders) is generally supported by research evidence (Gonzales-Prendez and Brisebois, 2012; Hofmann et al., 2012). While treatment techniques for specific disorders may differ, CBT models share the same core approaches to treatment. CBT generally involves brief, time-limited, present-focused, and problem-solving approaches (Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, n.d.; Gonzales-Prendez and Brisebois, 2012). CBT approaches have been developed for individual, group, couples, and family counselling practice (Gonzales-Prendez and Brisebois, 2012). CBT may be limited, however, by its primarily Eurocentric nature: less evidence exists for its efficacy with cross-cultural approaches involving diverse populations (ibid.).</p>

	<p>Practitioners using cognitive behavioural strategies work with clients to understand the thought patterns that lead to certain behaviours, as well as factors that sustain these patterns or behaviours. The goal is to help the client re-interpret events in her or his environment and reshape the conditions that are sustaining the negative behaviours. Practitioners and clients collaborate in identifying needs, planning treatment, and identifying and challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. Clients are seen as being able to actively shape their lives and determine problems and goals.</p>

	<p>Techniques that may be used in CBT include systematic questioning and inductive reasoning, reattribution of negative outcomes to external influence rather than internal causation, challenging &ldquo;general rules&rdquo; shaping perceptions of experiences, and confronting anxious responses to specific triggers (e.g., phobias) (Miller, 2005).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">CBT&rsquo;s Effectiveness in Treating Common Mental Health Disorders</p>

	<p>Although some clinicians, researchers, and scholars have raised questions about cognitive behavioural therapy&rsquo;s overall effectiveness, many believe that CBT works to alleviate a variety of conditions (e.g., mood disorders, anxiety, personality disorders, eating disorders, and substance use disorders). During cognitive behavioural therapy, the client works with a mental health counsellor in a structured way, attending a specific number of sessions.</p>

	<p>The basic steps in a CBT intervention are outlined below.</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			
			<li class="li--bullet">Identify critical behaviours.</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">Determine whether such behaviours are excesses or deficits.</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">Evaluate behaviours for frequency, duration, and intensity (in order to obtain a baseline).</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">Attempt to decrease the frequency, duration, and intensity of behaviours if there are excesses or attempting to increase such behaviours if there are deficits.</li>
			<li class="li--bullet">Clients are often expected to complete homework in order to apply the skills they learn in therapy sessions to their everyday lives.</li>

		</ul>

	<p>CBT is a structured, goal-oriented treatment that emphasizes the &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; rather than the past. Clients learn skills and strategies to manage current symptoms and prevent relapses. CBT is widely used for group treatment of social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder/dysthymia. There are many variations, including exposure therapy (exposing the individual to his or her painful memories) and relaxation training (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Mindfulness-Based Practice</p>

	<p>Mindfulness has become widespread as an intervention strategy, and it has well-researched applications in social work. With roots in Eastern Buddhist traditions, mindfulness has been effectively adapted as (1) a treatment intervention, (2) a mode of self-care, and (3) a way to enhance the client&ndash;worker helping relationship (Hick, 2009; Hick and Bien, 2008). Mindfulness involves purposefully paying attention to the present moment with an attitude of openness, non-judgement, and acceptance.</p>

	<p>Mindfulness as a social work intervention strategy with individuals or groups is commonplace today. Mindfulness represents a shift from a &lsquo;&lsquo;doing&rsquo;&rsquo; mode to a &lsquo;&lsquo;being&rsquo;&rsquo; mode. A &ldquo;being&rdquo; mode accepts what is happening in the present moment and incorporates experiencing the present directly and unconditionally without asking ourselves &ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is it bad?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>A number of benefits have been identified in the research literature (Hick, 2009: 9&ndash;10):</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			
			<li class="li--bullet-item">a clear awareness of one&rsquo;s thoughts and emotions,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">an ability to relate in new ways to pain and difficulties,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">healthy emotional processing and regulation,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">facilitation of a mental &ldquo;space&rdquo; where creative solutions can arise,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">the development of self-awareness and a positive self-image,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">a greater sense of well-being and ease in the world,</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">an ability to respond to stress more effectively, and</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item">an ability to make choices with greater clarity and awareness.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>A primary practice or skill cultivated in mindfulness interventions is meditation. Meditation allows us to develop the capacity to pay attention in a controlled environment with less sensory stimulation than is normally present in our daily lives. Once meditation is cultivated in this environment, it can more easily be transferred to our everyday lives. Both formal and informal meditation practices and nonmeditation-based exercises such as tai chi are currently used to cultivate mindfulness. Formal meditation involves sustained attention on a particular object (e.g., the breath) or choiceless awareness (of whatever thoughts arise). An example of this kind of meditation is an exercise called Awareness of Breathing. The best way to understand formal meditation practice is to meditate. This can be done while sitting, lying down, moving (yoga is meditation in motion), or standing. Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.</p>

	<p>Social worker self-care is a growing area that is benefitting from mindfulness practice. Several studies have found that mindfulness can build a practitioner&rsquo;s resilience, protect the brain against the damaging effects of stress, and produce the same effects on mood and the brain as anti-depressant medications. Within the client&ndash;therapist relationship, mindfulness is a way of paying attention with empathy, presence, and deep listening that can be cultivated, sustained, and integrated into the work of therapists.</p>

	<p>This is particularly important, since research has consistently shown that it is the strength of the therapeutic relationship itself that accounts for a large proportion of effective therapeutic outcomes. Virtually all mindfulness-based interventions insist that practitioners take part in their own daily mindfulness practice before they consider using mindfulness with clients, and that they practise for a significant period of time&mdash;often two years or more&mdash;before doing so.</p>

        <p class="text--caption">Mindfulness in the context of social work involves being present, through attention and awareness, “in the moment” without judgement, moving beyond what human senses can directly experience and everyday states of awareness and taken-for-granted perceptions. It is linked to a holistic conception of social work practice that integrates spiritual approaches and mind–body techniques reflecting equal attention to mind, body, emotional, and spiritual experiences.</p>

<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Interventions Drawing on Mindfulness</p>

	<p>Mindfulness is being used in group settings in programs such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), the most widely used mindfulness intervention. MBSR has been shown to be effective in dealing with chronic pain, stress, caregiver stress, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, psoriasis, cancer, and suicidal behaviour. Such interventions aim first of all to gain insight into how stress and distress are increased by automatic and habitual patterns and by cognitive reactivity to sensations, thoughts, and emotions. Second, they aim to reduce vulnerability to these mind states, eventually leading to lasting improvements in emotional well-being.</p>

	<p>Building on MBSR, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was developed as a treatment approach to reduce relapse and recurrence of depression (Segal, Williams, et al., 2002). MBCT focuses on teaching people to notice the effects of negative thoughts and how to change their relationships to them. Clinical trials have found that MBCT can reduce the likelihood of relapse by 40 to 50 percent in people who have suffered three or more previous episodes of depression.</p>

	<p>Other variations on mindfulness include dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Originally developed to treat people with borderline personality disorder, DBT integrates behavioural therapy with mindfulness practices (Linehan, 1993). ACT therapy takes an overall wellness approach and is not targeted at a particular illness or disorder but rather aims to alter the harmful effects of unwanted thoughts and feelings by modifying the psychological contexts in which such feelings are experienced by the client.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Solutions-Focused Practice Model</p>

	<p> A solutions-focused practice model is based on the belief that people have the necessary inner resources to resolve their problems and contribute to their own growth and change (Corcoran and Pillai, 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Lee, 2013). The key to this approach is encouraging people to visualize the goals they would like to achieve&mdash;how they would like their lives to be&mdash;and what is needed to make that happen, focusing on the present and the future rather than the past. It focuses on asking &ldquo;how&rdquo; to attain goals, rather than asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; problems have originated (Grant and O&rsquo;Connor, 2010).</p>

	<p>A solutions-based practice model aligns with social work values and goals, including a strengths-based perspective, collaborative therapeutic relationships, client empowerment and resilience, and a systems perspective focusing on the context of individual behaviour (Corcoran and Pillai, 2009; Kim and al., 2010). This model is based on the assumption that people do not need to know the cause of a problem in order to identify and attain solutions and goals, and that people should be held accountable for solutions rather than responsible for problems (Grant and O&rsquo;Connor, 2010; Lee, 2013).</p>

	<p>A solutions-focused approach is &rdquo;constructivist&rdquo; insofar as knowledge about reality and experiences is constructed through social interactions, language, and dialogue. In this sense, solutions-focused practitioners use language, questions, and dialogue to shape how clients perceive their problems, potential solutions, goals, and expected change.</p>

	<p>Solutions-focused practitioners ask clients to think about possible solutions to problems and to identify ways in which they can move toward creating a viable solution . Practitioners may use a range of questions to help clients identify their strengths, resources, and solutions, including exception questions (e.g., about times when the problem was absent or less intense), miracle questions (e.g., describing what ideal or perfect solutions to problems would look like), coping questions (e.g., about times when clients successfully coped with problems), and relationship questions (e.g., about how significant others might react to solutions and changes) (Corcoran and Pillai, 2009; Grant and O&rsquo;Connor, 2010; Lee,&#160;2013).</p>

	<p>Solutions-focused approaches can be effective in various contexts, including crisis intervention, child protection, family therapy, and school settings, addressing issues such as behavioural problems, substance use, mental health, and family or marital conflict. Such approaches can also inform management and supervision practices . Solutions-focused approaches are generally brief or time limited, and may be used with individuals, couples, families, and groups (Corcoran and Pillai, 2009; Lee, 2013). Specific solutions-focused clinical approaches have been developed and assessed, such as Solution-Therapeutic Brief Therapy (SFBT) (Kim&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2010).</p>

	<p>Typically, solution-focused therapy (SFT) is a short-term, strengths-oriented intervention that identifies and enhances clients&rsquo; resources in coping with life&rsquo;s&#160;difficulties. Recent research generally supports the efficacy of solutions-focused approaches, suggesting that they contribute to increased self-efficacy, a positive outlook, and psychological well-being. Interventions based on solutions-focused approaches appear to increase clients&rsquo; understanding of the nature of the problem affecting them and support client goal attainment (Corcoran and Pillai, 2009; Grant and O&rsquo;Connor, 2010).</p>

        <p class="text--caption">A form of psychotherapy that seeks to help people identify their values, skills, and knowledge so that they can confront whatever problems they may face. In essence, the therapist seeks to help the client co-author a new narrative about themselves. Narrative therapy challenges the dominant discourses that shape people’s lives. The approach was developed during the 1970s and 1980s, largely by social workers Michael White of Australia and David Epston of New Zealand.</p>

<section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Narrative-Based Practice Models</p>

	<p>Narrative-based practice models view storytelling as an integral part of the way in which we communicate with one another and make sense of our experiences (McLeod, 2006). Narrative approaches focus on the meanings that people can find and create in their life stories, as well as the extent to which people feel their lived experiences are represented within their own stories, as told by themselves or by others (White and Epston, 1990).</p>

	<p>Underlying narrative therapy is a view that a person&rsquo;s beliefs, skills, principles, and knowledge can be the means to help them reclaim their lives in the face of problems. A narrative therapist aims to help clients examine, evaluate, and change their relationship to a problem by acting as an &ldquo;investigative reporter&rdquo; who is not at the centre of the investigation but who is nonetheless influential; that is, the therapist poses questions that help people externalize the problem and then investigate it as thoroughly and reflectively as possible.</p>

	<p>Clients are encouraged to describe their life stories, reflecting their subjective lived experiences. They are then encouraged to re-tell stories in a way that represents how they wish to live their lives, integrating current experiences and future goals (Phipps and Vorster, 2009; White and Epston, 1990). Through this process of telling and re-telling their stories, clients are encouraged to explore the different, and changing, meanings associated with events, people, or issues in their lives (Phipps and Vorster, 2009). This process is intended to empower clients by strengthening skills, beliefs, commitments, and resources that can be used to reduce the impacts of problems or challenges in their lives (Dulwich Centre Publications, 2009).</p>

	<p>Narrative therapy can be adapted for practice with individuals, families, and groups, as well as with different age groups (Ricks, Kitchens, Goodrich, and Hancock, 2014). In general, narrative approaches suggest that a client&rsquo;s challenges or concerns are not simply &ldquo;personal&rdquo; problems. Rather, they are &ldquo;external&rdquo; to the client (whether individual or family), rooted in their community, socio-economic status, and political histories and contexts (Cobb and Negash, 2010; Hoffman, 2002; Payne, 2006). Drawing on this perspective, narrative approaches support clients in &ldquo;externalizing&rdquo; the problem (that is, in separating the problem from the person), and in understanding the problem and exploring possible responses to it within a broader socio-political context (White and Epston, 1990). The primary focus in narrative therapy is on the relationship between clients and their broader contexts (Dulwich Centre Publications, 2009).</p>

	<p>Narrative therapists support the exploration of life stories and the identification of possible responses through careful listening and attention to the whole story, attempting to understand the client&rsquo;s intentions and goals rather than focusing on understanding the causes of life problems (Hibel and Polanco, 2010). A number of tools have been developed to facilitate narrative therapy approaches, drawing on various creative techniques. These include visual arts, photography, videos, and music, as well as memoirs, journaling, and scripts (Ricks et al., 2010). These techniques can facilitate the construction and reconstruction of life stories, including the examination and reframing of meanings or consciousness associated with life events and experiences (Wallis, Burns, and Capdevila, 2011).</p>

	<p>In a narrative approach to practice, the therapist aims to adopt a collaborative therapeutic posture rather than imposing ideas on people by giving them advice. Both the therapist and the clients who consult them are seen as having valuable information, in terms of both the process of the therapeutic conversations and the content of these conversations.</p>

	<p>A high degree of creativity lies at the core of generalist social work practice. Unique situations often demand creative and imaginative solutions, and the social work practitioner is frequently called upon to take risks, learn from mistakes, draw on unusual intervention techniques, and display flexibility. &ldquo;The introduction of imaginative techniques into the daily practice of social workers in a structured and systematic manner can greatly enhance the performance of practice,&rdquo; notes Gelfend (1988).</p>

	<p>In the field of social work today, there has been no shortage of creative and innovative approaches to helping individuals, families, and communities. Linda Turner has observed that creativity comes into play in social work in five main areas: (1) creative expression, (2)&#160;creative presentation of self by the social worker, (3) creative conceptualization at the direct practice level, (4) creative conceptualization at the community practice level, and (5) a &ldquo;creative cosmology&rdquo; paradigm. She concludes that imagination, creativity, and innovation will continue to be in high demand in social work as new situations unfold with clients and as social work practice adapts to respond to these new situations (Turner, 1999). Below, a few creative, arts-based techniques are discussed.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Creative Arts Therapy</p>

	<p>There is no debate about the need for scientifically-validated and evidence-based approaches to social work practice. However, much of social work practice involves creative initiatives that recognize the unique history, strengths, and culture of the client. Creative arts therapy in its many forms offers a way to reach clients and validate their experiences by allowing them to &ldquo;tell their stories&rdquo; in powerful ways. The use of creative arts therapy aligns perfectly with the overall social work strategies of empowerment and building on clients&rsquo; own strengths.</p>

	<p>Art therapy involves the integration of art and psychotherapy (Vick, 2003), and has been defined as the &ldquo;use [of] art media, the creative process, and the resulting artwork to explore [clients&rsquo;] feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behaviour and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety, and increase self-esteem&rdquo; (American Art Therapy Association, 2013: 1). Art forms used during the therapeutic process might include drawing, painting, sculpture, and other media. Although individual art therapists may draw on different approaches and favour different areas of therapeutic focus, they use art practice to promote individuals&rsquo; mental, physical, and emotional well-being and development (Vick, 2003).</p>

	<p>Art therapy can engage people from diverse backgrounds, supporting individuals and groups as well as couples and families. During the art therapy process, clients can share their thoughts and feelings through both individual and group art activities, and art forms can represent new means of expression and communication with partners or family or group members (Vick, 2003). Art therapy is widely adapted in different settings, including community services, schools, hospitals, rehabilitation or wellness centres, and other clinical facilities. Art therapy can respond to an array of therapeutic needs, including social and psychological needs as well as developmental, medical, and educational challenges (American Art Therapy Association, 2013). Four primary theoretical orientations in contemporary art therapy have been identified, each having a particular emphasis or area of focus: (1) psychodynamic approaches, (2)&#160;humanistic approaches, (3) learning and developmental approaches, and (4) family therapy approaches (Vick, 2003).</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Play Therapy</p>

	<p>Play therapy uses &ldquo;the therapeutic powers of play to help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth and development&rdquo; (U.S. Association for Play Therapy, 2013). While play therapists may work with couples or families, they focus on children, providing them the opportunity to share and explore their feelings, and to interact positively with others and develop social skills (Gaikwad, Lalitha, and Seshadri, 2015; Peterson and Boswell, 2015). Play therapists observe children&rsquo;s behaviours in order to better understand and support them and improve their health and well-being. Play therapy is based on the development of healthy and trusting relationships between therapists and children and on encouraging children to express themselves in their own ways.</p>

	<p>Play therapy has been widely used with children who have been traumatized (e.g., through abuse, domestic violence, or disaster) or who have experienced loss, as well as with children in adoptive care or foster care. Research indicates that play therapy is indeed effective in helping children, who can develop the ability to deal with difficulties in constructive and healthy ways when they are given positive feedback, using appropriate modes of communication (e.g. play), in safe and healthy situations (Bratton and Ray, 2000; Bratton, Ray, Rhine, and Jones, 2005; Gaikwad et al., 2015).</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Any child that has any sort of problem they need to discuss or be able to process would make a good candidate for play therapy,&rdquo; says Elena Mazza, M.S.W., L.C.S.W., an assistant professor in the play therapy program and coordinator at the School of Social Work at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s too hard to put into words, they can work on it with play,&rdquo; adds Dr. Theresa Aiello, co-director of the Advanced Certificate in Child and Family Therapy at New York University&rsquo;s Silver School of Social Work.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Photovoice Therapies</p>

	<p>Photovoice is a participatory intervention technique that combines photography with social action (Schwartz et al., 2007). It is &ldquo;a process by which people can identify, represent, and enhance their community through a specific photographic technique&rdquo; (Wang and Burris, 1997: 369), aiming to support personal and community change (Wang, Yi, Tao, and Carovano, 1998).</p>

	<p>The photovoice process involves documenting individual, family, and community realities (including strengths, concerns, and needs) through photographs, using these images to communicate experiences and knowledge. Photographs are used as a starting point for group discussions, to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important social issues, and to engage with policy makers to promote broader change (Wang, 1999; Wang and Burris, 1997).</p>

	<p>The photovoice intervention is centred on principles of individual and community strengths, capacity building, empowerment, and action (e.g., policy influence) (Catalani and Minkler, 2010; Wang et al., 1998). Elements of the photovoice process, such as participation in research, training, critical dialogue with other community members, and a role as a community change agent can play a key role in empowerment (Catalani and Minkler, 2010) . For people with varying degrees of power, photovoice participation can contribute to the development of new relationships; increased awareness through the exchange of ideas; improved status (peer status, as well as political, social, material, and academic status); increased credibility through affiliation, collaboration, and recognition; and enhanced self-esteem, sense of control over life and relationships, and access to power. Photovoice approaches can also contribute to broader social change and innovation.</p>

        <h3 class="text--smaller text--bold">Digital Storytelling</h3>

        <p class="text--caption">Digital storytelling involves the use of digital technologies (e.g., computers, cameras, recorders) to communicate with others and to express life stories, experiences, events, emotions, information, and so on (Burgess, 2006; Robin, 2008).</p>

        <p class="text--caption">Widely used in social work education, research, and daily practice, digital storytelling can facilitate more engaging and more proactive relationships. For example, the use of digital storytelling with refugee communities provides an opportunity for them to share their life experiences (Lenette, Cox, and Brough, 2015).</p>

        <p class="text--caption">Similarly, the use of digital storytelling in social work courses on oppression and social justice can encourage students to reflect on practice issues in relation to oppression and diversity (Walsh, Shier, Sitter, and Sieppert, 2010).</p>
