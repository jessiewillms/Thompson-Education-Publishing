small_image_caption_text_1: "After a four-year consultation, the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) framed a new definition of social work practice in 2014: “Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities are central to social work. Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and Indigenous knowledge, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing.”"

	<p>The network of social welfare laws, policies, and programs currently in place around the country is vast. This complex system provides an underlying buffer against contingencies that can arise, often unexpectedly, and cause great hardship for individuals and their families. It is through such programs that the Canadian state creates opportunities for individuals experiencing difficulties in their lives and helps them get back on their feet.</p>

	<p>On both the income security and the social services sides, there are different classes of welfare services. One important distinction is between public and private welfare programs.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Public Welfare Services</p>

	<p>Because Canada is a federal state, <span class="span-keyword text--red">public welfare</span> is provided, in different forms, through the three levels of government: the federal or national government, the provincial and territorial governments, and the regional and municipal governments. Typically, agencies are created and charged with overseeing and delivering income security and social services to citizens on behalf of the government.</p>

	<p>As well, there are “public” non-government agencies that provide services. These include advisory and appeal boards, which are the creations of government (federal, provincial, or municipal), consisting of members who are appointed from the public by government. They are either completely independent or quasi-independent of the government’s own agencies.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Private Welfare Services</p>

	<p>There is also what can be referred to as <span class="span-keyword text--red">private welfare</span>, or programs funded by voluntary charitable contributions from individuals and private organizations, by fees people pay for the services they receive, or by funds spent by corporations to provide social welfare services to their employees.</p>

	<p>Here, a distinction can be drawn between two types of private delivery organizations: private non-profit and private for-profit.</p>
		
		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Non-profit </span><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">organizations</span> are mandated to provide a service or an activity, but not to create a profit. In Canada, these organizations are often registered, and rules and regulations govern their operation. Many are incorporated as non-profit corporations. Often, they receive funds from one or more levels of government. Indeed, governments seem to be moving more toward this delivery model. By moving services into non-unionized smaller agencies, labour costs and liability are lowered.</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">For-profit </span><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">organizations </span>are prevalent in certain income security areas (for example, pensions and insurance) and social service areas (for example, nursing homes, psychotherapy, home care, and child care). They essentially provide services for a fee and generate a profit for the owner offering the service. With government cutbacks in recent years, more and more services are being provided by for-profit or commercial agencies.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Non-profit and for-profit service providers, along with public government and non-government agencies, form the backbone of the social welfare system in Canada today. Sometimes it is an uneasy alliance. Advocates of private, for-profit welfare maintain that a for-profit system allows more choice (for example, private pension and insurance plans). Opponents point out, however, that the private system favours those most able to afford it, fosters social inequality, and undermines the public system.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Approaches to Social Welfare Provision</p>

	<p>In general, the idea that governments should provide income security and social supports to citizens if they are genuinely in need is not highly disputed in Canada (although it certainly is in the United States). Nevertheless, major disputes arise in determining exactly which groups are genuinely in need and to what extent they may need state assistance. Canadian governments have moved back and forth between two broad approaches to social welfare. These are sometimes referred to as the “residual view” and the “institutional view.”</p>

		<ul class="ul--list">
			<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">The residual view. </span>In this view, social welfare is a limited response to human need, implemented only when all else fails. It is based on the premise that there are two “natural” ways through which an individual’s needs are met: the family and the market economy. The state should only step in when these normal supports fail. Social welfare should be targeted to those most in need, and typically, benefits are at a low level (so as to discourage abuse).</li>
			<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">The institutional view. </span>In this view, social welfare exists to ensure that everyone has a reasonable standard of living and health. In a complex industrial society such as ours, the argument goes, access to income supports and social services promotes a sense of civic solidarity and helps to even out inequalities that may be no fault of the individual concerned.</li>
		</ul>


	<p>Until the Great Depression of the 1930s and its aftermath, social welfare programs in Canada were essentially residualist in nature. Welfare was only for those demonstrably in need. In the period after World War II, the idea that welfare services were necessary to any civilized society became more widespread. Since the turn of the century, if not earlier, policymakers have reverted to a more restricted notion, making cutbacks in welfare spending across the board.</p>
