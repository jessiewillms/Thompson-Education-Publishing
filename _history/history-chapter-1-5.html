	<p>The social work profession is a personally taxing one. It requires a unique range of aptitudes and skills. Social workers and social service workers are called upon to uphold the highest standards of care and professionalism in relation to their clients and the highest professional and ethical standards in their relations with their colleagues.</p>

	<p>A social work practitioner may need to assume a number of different roles, depending on the nature of their job and the approach to practice that they use. Obviously, the role that is selected and applied is the one that will be the most effective with a particular client in the particular circumstances.</p>

	<p>Below are just some of the many roles that the social worker or social service worker needs to assume in the course of their work in helping clients get back on their feet:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Strategist. </span>The role of strategist involves the worker in helping people organize to help themselves; for example, helping a community identify problems, explore and select strategies, and organize and mobilize to address the problems.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Broker. </span>A broker links individuals and groups who need help; for example, linking a woman who is abused by her partner to a shelter for battered women.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Advocate. </span>In the role of advocate, the worker provides leadership in advocating on behalf of a person or in challenging an institution’s decision not to provide services.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Initiator. </span>The initiator calls attention to problems or the problems a particular policy or program may cause and follows up with colleagues or with an interdisciplinary team.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Mediator. </span>The role of mediator involves participating as a neutral player in disputes between parties to help them reconcile differences or achieve mutually beneficial agreements.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Negotiator. </span>As a negotiator, the social worker is allied with one side in a dispute and tries to achieve agreement by bargaining on his or her client’s behalf.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Activist. </span>The activist seeks to change institutions and structures in society, helping to organize people to shift power and resources to oppressed or disadvantaged groups.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Educator. </span>As an educator, the social worker provides information and resources and raises awareness of problems and solutions.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Coordinator. </span>The social worker is frequently a coordinator, bringing all the pieces together in an organized manner to accomplish a task.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Researcher. </span>As a researcher, the social worker gathers information for inclusion in databases and stays abreast of new findings in her or his field.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Facilitator. </span>The group facilitator may lead a group activity as part of group therapy, a self-help group, or any other type of group.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--grey">Spokesperson.</span> The social worker may be engaged as a public speaker at schools, at conferences or workshops, at events staged by service organizations, at meetings with police, or at gatherings within related agencies.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In whatever context social workers find themselves, they conduct themselves in a professional manner, using the knowledge and skills they have at their disposal and taking into account the specific needs of the client and the range of interventions currently available.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red ">Social Workers and Social Service Workers</p>

	<p>A social work practitioner may be either a social worker or a social service worker. While there is not a clear separation between the two bodies of knowledge associated with a social worker and a social service worker, these categories are not interchangeable.</p>

	<p>“Diagnostic services” are the purview of social workers (or in some provinces clinical social workers), whereas “diagnosis” has been excluded from the scope of practice for social service work. This means the<span class="span-keyword text--red"> social worker </span>can make a series of judgements as to the nature of a situation and formulate the actions to be taken, or not taken, actions for which the social worker can be held accountable. The <span class="span-keyword text--red">social service worker</span>, on the other hand, may follow a suggested course of action based on a diagnosis, but he or she will not be the person who has arrived at such a judgement. The rationale for this is that the certification process is different for the social worker and the social service worker. The shorter time frame for the completion of a social service work program generally limits the depth and breadth of the interpersonal and social theory taught to social service workers.</p>

	<p>For example, the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers specifies the scope of practice of the profession of social work as “the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of individual, interpersonal, and societal problems through the use of social work knowledge, skills, interventions, and strategies, to assist individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial and social functioning.” When the College specifies the scope of practice for social service work, the words “diagnosis” and “psychosocial” are omitted.</p>
