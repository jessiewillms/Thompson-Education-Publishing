<p>Sam, 35, is an avid motorcyclist. One spring evening, he and his friends were out riding in a rural area and it started to rain. The roads were slippery and Sam&rsquo;s cycle went out of control and hit a bridge abutment. Once safely in hospital, Sam underwent a series of tests. He had no sensation in his arms or legs. After being referred to the rehabilitation team for assessment, he began to recover sensation and use of his arms but none in his legs. It was at that time that Richard, the team&rsquo;s social worker, was called into the case.</p>

<p>Richard met with Sam to conduct a psychosocial assessment. Apart from the recent injury, Sam was in good physical health. He was married and he and his wife Sue had two young children, Alyson, 3, and Jake, 4. Sam&rsquo;s mother and father were retired and lived nearby. Sam and his family lived in a modest home with a mortgage in the suburbs of a large city.</p>

<p>Sam worked in construction as a bricklayer but during the winter he was not always able to find work. Sam also volunteered at a local public school coaching children in volleyball. Sue had returned to school to complete a degree in accounting. Sam played an active role as a father, tending to the needs of the children while his wife attended classes in the evenings. Sue was usually at home with the children during the day. When Sam was working and Sue had academic assignments to do during the day, his parents or a babysitter cared for the children.</p>

<p>Sam was experiencing an intense emotional reaction to the accident. He described his anxiety as &ldquo;skyrocketing&ldquo; when the rehabilitation team and his doctor concluded that Sam would not likely regain the use of his lower body. He panicked about his possible inability to work to support his family, especially while his wife completed her studies. He was also worried about his current inability to control his bowel and bladder functions and the possible effect of his disability on his sexual functioning. He faced many problems in the face of these drastic changes in his life and their implications for his family&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>Richard began by working directly with Sam to provide him with emotional support, encouraging Sam to talk about his sadness, grief, and anger. After a few weeks, Sam&rsquo;s emotions became less volatile. Together, Richard and Sam identified the issues in Sam&rsquo;s life that needed the most urgent intervention. They decided to prioritize Sam&rsquo;s strong desire to get back to work. As a result, he increased time spent with the occupational therapist and the physiotherapist so he could build up his capacity to return to some form of work. The rehabilitation team worked with Sam for several months.</p>

<p>Richard and Sam began to focus specifically on discharge planning. They met with Sue to discuss concerns such as child care, Sue&rsquo;s wish to complete her education, financial stresses, Sam&rsquo;s incontinence, and his sexual functioning. Richard reassured the children that their father would get better and would return home soon but that he would need to use a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Richard worked with Sam to navigate and mobilize community resources to help the family apply for disability benefits, subsidized child care, and other similar supports. Sue applied for and received a scholarship. Sue and Sam were relieved because this would allow her to complete her studies and re-enter the workforce to help support the family.</p>

<p>After discussions with Richard, Sam admitted it was unrealistic for him to return to his former job. However, he expressed an interest in helping out in elementary schools. He began to phone school-based contacts that Richard had provided to see what opportunities might be available. He decided to volunteer at an elementary school down the street from where he lived. This would give him a chance to explore future career options while completing rehabilitation from home. He was now using an electric wheelchair both at home and on sidewalks. Richard found a mechanic who reconditioned vehicles previously used by others with disabilities similar to Sam&rsquo;s. The mechanic kindly offered to adapt a vehicle for Sam free of charge after his rehab treatment was complete. Sam and Sue began to feel hopeful for their family&rsquo;s future and seemed to be adapting to the jolting changes in their lives fairly well.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Richard referred the family to a community social worker with expertise in working with persons with issues such as those Sam was facing as he began a new life back in the community.</p>
