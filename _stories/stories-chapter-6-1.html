<p>One of the primary roles of social workers in hospitals is discharge planning. Ensuring that patients are discharged from hospital in a timely manner with appropriate supports in place once they return home requires numerous skills. Social workers must be able to</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--no-bullet">work cooperatively with other staff as part of a multidisciplinary treatment team,</li>

		<li class="li--no-bullet">apply sharp analytical and assessment skills,</li>

		<li class="li--no-bullet">communicate clearly, patiently, and compassionately with patients and staff,</li>

		<li class="li--no-bullet">initiate a therapeutic relationship with the patient in a timely manner,</li>

		<li class="li--no-bullet">process paperwork efficiently, and</li>

		<li class="li--no-bullet">advocate for the patient&rsquo;s best interests.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Discharging a patient may involve ensuring that home care services or other follow-up services are set up. An individual&rsquo;s discharge can become complicated, for example, when dealing with a previously homeless person with multiple psychosocial and addictions issues. Perhaps a bereaved couple have lost a child and will require either follow-up grief counselling or marital counselling. Or perhaps an older adult cannot return home but must be put on a waiting list for transfer to an assisted-living facility. Sometimes even simple issues need attention; for example, a patient&rsquo;s discharge could be delayed because they do not have a winter coat.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Facilitating Post-Hospitalization Recovery and Supports</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, a team approach is used increasingly in health care to ensure that each patient&rsquo;s needs are being met as completely and effectively as possible. This approach can prove beneficial during a patient&rsquo;s hosptial discharge planning stage as well.</p>

<p>Social workers bring a unique perspective to health care in this respect. Their assessments help establish a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; context for each individual&rsquo;s life circumstances, and their empathy, insights, and recommendations can increase chances for recovery. Many patients are living with concerns about employment, housing, child rearing, marginalization, social supports, and, most of all, poverty. Affordable, high-quality child care, employment insurance for part-time workers or workers suddenly faced with a disability, improved working conditions for those in high-stress, low-income positions, and increases in affordable housing&mdash;all these factors have a direct effect on health outcomes. Social workers are especially aware of the importance of such factors on wellness and they are prepared and able to address them in the interests of their clients, some of whom may be overwhelmed at the prospect of returning home after a period of hospitalization.</p>

<p>In Sam&rsquo;s story, a young man undergoes a traumatic injury and loses the use of his legs. His initial reaction to this loss is one of intense anxiety verging on panic, followed by bouts of anger and depression. The hospital social worker called in to support the man and his young family must first support them in coming to terms with their grief. The social worker then helps the family adapt to their changed circumstances, avail themselves of financial and community supports, and move forward with a sense of renewed hope for their future.</p>
