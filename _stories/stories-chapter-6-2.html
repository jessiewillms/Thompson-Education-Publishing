<p>Sally has been a social worker at a community health centre for eight years. The health centre is located in the heart of the Southeast Asian community in Vancouver. Sally runs support groups and offers individual and family counselling as well, receiving referrals from health care workers in the community. Individuals can also self-refer for access to services offered by the community heath centre.</p>

<p>Sally has received 15 files of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. After reviewing the list, Sally decides to offer a breast cancer support group at the CHC. She telephones each person on the list and arranges to meet with them individually to assess their suitability and their interest in joining the group. One woman does not wish to be part of a group but requests personal counselling from Sally instead, and Sally complies. Ultimately, eight women, four of southeast Asian descent, would like to participate in the group.</p>

<p>Among the participants is Kicho, a 37-year-old woman who has been advised by her medical team to undergo aggressive treatment for breast cancer to increase her odds of survival. Kicho has two young children and she is terrified that she will die as a result of her illness. Kicho&rsquo;s husband, parents, brother, and friends do not yet know about her diagnosis.</p>

<p>Sally structures the group to be held for two hours once a week for ten weeks in the early evening to allow women who are working to attend. All eight women attend the first meeting. The women enter the room tentatively and sit in a circle of comfortable chairs. Sally introduces herself, talks about the need for confidentiality and active listening, and sets forth other norms such as having only one person speak at a time. She then invites the members to introduce themselves. When it is Kicho&rsquo;s turn, she shares how alone she feels as she struggles with her diagnosis. Others in the group ask her about her family and she tells them about her children, her husband, her other family members, and her friends. As she speaks, she becomes teary and says she cries a lot now. Other members of the group then share their stories. Some are similar to Kicho&rsquo;s story and others differ. One older woman says that she, too, is alone with her fears as she has no one to share them with. She encourages Kicho to talk with her husband. Kicho nods, but says that she is not sure whether that would be a good idea. The weeks unfold as women continue to tell their stories and support each other.</p>

<p>During the fifth group meeting, Kicho tearfully reveals her marriage problems to the other women. Her husband had had an intimate affair that ended when Kicho found out about it two years ago. Although the affair is over, Kicho is worried that her husband will abandon her again after she has undergone breast surgery.</p>

<p>Sally looks around the room and notes that some other women also have tears in their eyes. She comments, &ldquo;It seems that Kicho&rsquo;s story is troubling for many of you around the circle. Does anyone have anything they wish to say?&rdquo; Silence follows as members look at the floor or wipe their eyes with tissues. After a few minutes, which seems like an eternity to Sally, Mary speaks up.</p>

<p>Mary explains her fear of ending the treatment process with a less-than-perfect body. She said, &ldquo;My appearance has always been so important to me. Isn&rsquo;t it important to every woman?&rdquo; Kicho replies, &ldquo;Well, yes, but living is more important to me than my appearance. But I am not sure my husband feels the same way.&rdquo; Others in the group nod and express their understanding.</p>

<p>Sally listens intently but does not speak, waiting for other comments. A deep discussion about women and beauty ensues. Comments follow about wanting to live, yearning to see children and grandchildren grow up, being proud of their good health and their bodies. The discussion then turns to intimate partners and their responses to their female partner&rsquo;s disease. Kicho says she is surprised that the other women seem to understand her fears. She reports that she often gets blank stares from people on the few occasions when she shares her private concerns.</p>

<p>The following week, the women decide they want their partners to have an opportunity to participate in a support group as well. Sally promises to speak with her supervisor to find out if there are space and resources at the centre for her to run a partners&rsquo; support group in parallel with the breast cancer support group.</p>
