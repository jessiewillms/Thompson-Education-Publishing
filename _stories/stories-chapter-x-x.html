<p>Sidney, a 38-year-old computer technician, is at risk of dying from non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. His wife, Josette, recently gave birth to an infant daughter, Chantal. Sidney&rsquo;s family lives in England and is seldom able to travel to Canada. Josette&rsquo;s family lives in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>

<p>As is often the case with complicated diagnoses, Sidney&rsquo;s diagnosis takes time to complete. Meanwhile, Kevin, a social worker employed as an occasional consultant with the hospital and who has a part-time position with a community health centre, is asked to meet with Sidney to see if he can help. Kevin agrees to accept the case.</p>

<p>Over time, Sidney has encountered many turning points in his illness and treatment. Sometimes a treatment made him feel better and doctors gave him positive reports. At other times, he received only bad news. At first the treatment worked, and then it didn&rsquo;t. Sidney tells Kevin that he feels as though he has been on an out-of-control rollercoaster ride. Kevin and Sidney develop a rapport with each other and agree to meet regularly.</p>

<p>After a few months, doctors are especially concerned about the results of one particular medical test. Sidney is feeling more tired and cuts and bruises are taking longer to heal. He is losing weight. He feels worried and depressed. Sidney tells Kevin that he fears he is dying and he asks Kevin what he should do. Kevin asks him: &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; Sidney responds, &ldquo;I need to know what is going on with my body.&rdquo; Kevin offers to sit down to talk with Sidney and his doctor. Sidney and Kevin draw up a list of questions that Sidney needs answered, including &ldquo;Am I dying? Is there anything you can do to help me?&rdquo; They discuss the possibility of having Josette attend the meeting, too. But Sidney wants to wait until he feels stronger emotionally in order to deal with Josette&rsquo;s reaction. The meeting with the doctor is emotionally draining but helpful overall. The doctor answers all Sidney&rsquo;s questions. Sidney learns that he is indeed dying.</p>

<p>Sidney and Kevin spend many hours talking about Sidney&rsquo;s impending death. Finally, Sidney asks Kevin to help him break the news to his wife.They all sit together in Sidney and Josette&rsquo;s home after Chantal has gone to bed. Kevin helps support Sidney as he tells Josette that he is dying. Sidney comforts Josette and answers as many of her questions as he can. Sidney asks Kevin if he thinks the doctor would be willing to meet with the three of them together. Kevin sets up a meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kevin asks Sidney and Josette what their major concerns are. Naturally, they are concerned about the progress of the illness, about the actual experience of death, and if there will be pain. Kevin teaches the couple about palliative care and the goal of ensuring comfort for the dying individual and for the family. They decide to ask the doctor what death might be like for Sidney. Sidney begins to cry and then asks two questions: &ldquo;How will my family survive without my income? And what about our wonderful little girl&mdash;how will she know who her father was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kevin is able to help ease these worries. They discuss financial issues and set up a budget. They discuss Josette&rsquo;s earning potential. Sidney has some creative ideas about ways in which Josette can juggle her career as an ultrasound technician while caring for Chantal. Finally, they talk about Sidney&rsquo;s relationship with Chantal. Sidney confides to Kevin that he deeply wishes his daughter to know about him as she grows up. Kevin helps Sidney develop some ideas aboout how to achieve this goal. Sidney is an amateur musician. He decides to compose and record a series of songs. Each song would be planned for Chantal to hear at a different stage of her life. The songs would reveal Sidney&rsquo;s love, hopes, and dreams for his daughter.</p>

<p>Ultimately, composing and listening to these songs together help Josette and Sidney face Sidney&rsquo;s death more calmly. The members of the palliative care team succeed in easing his pain and ensuring his physical comfort in his final days.</p>

<p>Not long after the songs are completed and recorded, Sidney and Josette plan his funeral. Sidney dies peacefully as soon as the planning is complete.</p>

<p>Kevin meets with Josette to offer her grief counselling. He helps her get through the first six weeks following Sidney&rsquo;s death and he introduces her to a bereavement support group at a local community centre for people who have lost their partners.</p>
